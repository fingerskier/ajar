# The Dunning-Kruger Effect

The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. 
The cognitive bias of illusory superiority comes from the inability of low-ability people to recognize their lack of ability. 
Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.


## Personal Application

Our confidence in our knowledge or abilities can be objectively gauged if we are so willing.
When we have confidence in some part of ourselves it can be tempered by evaluating how much study and effort has gone into that thing.
It is unlikely that we are experts in something we have not studied or practiced.
It is unlikely that we are world-class in some effort we have not adequately practiced.


## Socio-Political Application

When presented with an authority that exudes confidence they can also be evaluated by how much study and effort has gone into their expertise.
This is especially important when we are, ourselves, not an expert in some field.
Experts ought to evaluated compared to others in their field and according to their lifespan.
While it is possible for a young person to be brilliant and have studied very hard it is unlikely.
More importantly, leaders are typically not experts in anything; rather, those with whom they surround themselves ought to be evaluated to determine if the leader's decisiong-making basis is sound.
