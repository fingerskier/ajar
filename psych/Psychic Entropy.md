# Psychic Entropy

Starting from zero and working toward a goal leaves one vulnerable to being thrown off course.
Winds and obstacles impeded us and we must constantly redirect...wasting energy.

Starting from the goal and letting ourselves be drawn toward it is far more efficient.
After we pass obstacles we simply allow the thread to the goal to continue to pull us forward.
