Or is known, among those familiar with the flow, that the "camp high" (that preternatural ecstaticism following a deeply spiritual retreat) is powerful - and fleeting.  The question footer leaders, whose charges will naturally experience this high, is his to cope with it.

Do you try to prolong the high artificially and extend the trailer-off phase? or do you throw out a mattress and brace for the impact (1st aid kit in hand)?  Or neither?

I vote neither, if for no other reason than we ought to let cycles raise their course.  The only true way to avoid the descent is to avoid the ascent.  But avoiding such is no way to live.  Life is high and lows.

A wise man once said this, with the caveat that, with age, the peaks are sighter and the valleys shallower.  However, I believe the caveat is uncouth.  I have not perceived lesser curvature of ups and downs in my life- nor in my compatriots.  Suffice to say: those I desire to emulate have so learned to ride these waves that they make scary roses and falls seem trivial.

This triviality is not actual, though. it is the practiced effortlessness that comes from deliberate engagement with difficulty.  It is a willingness to endure coupled with humility.

Suffice, again, to say: endurance is not gotten from desire but from the performance fueled by the desire.  And humility is not simply a willingness to be pummeled but the preparations made for the inevitable downslide.
