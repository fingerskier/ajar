Or is known, among those familiar with the flow, that the "camp high" (that preternatural acsetecism following a deeply spiritual retreat) is powerful - and fleeting.
The question for leaders, whose charges will naturally experience this high, is how to cope with it.

Do you try to prolong the high artificially and extend the deconditioning phase?  or do you throw out a mattress and brace for the impact (1st aid kit in hand)?  Or neither?

I vote neither, if for no other reason than we ought to let cycles run their course.
The only true way to avoid the descent is to avoid the ascent.
Easier said than done- life is high and lows.

A wise man once said this with the caveat that, with age, the peaks are slighter and the valleys shallower.
However, we must consider the overall trajectory and the subject's tolerance.
I have not perceived lesser curvature of ups and downs in my life- nor in my compatriots.
Suffice to say: those I desire to emulate have so learned to ride these waves that they make scary rises and falls seem trivial.
And, from a distance, we perceive a clear upward trned in their lives (in terms of influence, wealth, and mood.)

It is the practiced effortlessness that comes from deliberate engagement with difficulty.
It is a willingness to endure coupled with humility.

Suffice to say: endurance is not gotten from desire but from the performance fueled by the desire.
Humility is not simply a willingness to be pummeled but the training that allows one to endure conflict.
