Sometimes I have a superiority complex, and other times an inferiority complex, how do I find which is the real one?


Les Matheson:

Neither of them are real. The part of your mind which is comparing you to others (and concluding either that you’re superior or inferior) is confused. It thinks that you’re a thing. Things can be compared to other things. Beings cannot be compared to other beings.

So the oscillation between “I’m better than others” and “I’m not good enough” is a kind of noise made by your ego maintenance machinery. It’s meaningless. But, the fact that you take this noise seriously, and believe that maybe it’s telling the truth some of the time, indicates that you’re not clear about who you are.

The machine that’s making this noise is not able to tell you who you are, that’s why it thrashes around between extremes. It’s trying to figure out who you are, but it has nothing reliable to act as a reference — there’s evidence for both viewpoints, yes? Some days you’re the pigeon, and some days you’re the statue.

True self is not some concept which can be compared to assess your value. True self is beyond all such concepts, it transcends concepts and images and narratives of self.

If you imagine that your ego is like a box, and your mind is walking around looking at the box from different angles, it is trying to figure out “what sort of box is this, and are the contents good or bad?” But that’s the wrong question, because you aren’t the box in the first place. You’re more like the space around the box, extending out infinitely in all directions. That’s not something which can be assessed by the box-comparator.
