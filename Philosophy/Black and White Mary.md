# Black & White Mary

## Premise & Question

Mary has lived her entire life in a black & white building where there are no colors but black and white.
She has become an expert on color.
She knows what colors things are "supposed", knows the wavelengths of all colors, and knows how the human brain processes colored imagery.
But she has never seen a colored object.

One day she exits the building and see colorful things for the first time.
Has she gained anything from the experience?


## Thesis

It is clear from the premise that she cannot gain new knowledge because she knows everything about color already.
As to whether she has gained or attained anything it is fair to say that "had" a new experience.
The conundrum is that experience in not knowledge.


## Further

Wisdom is the application of knowledge, an innovation of sorts.
But wisdom itself does not give new knowledge, it more like the patterning of existing knowledge.
Experience is similar but involves making associations between existing knowledge.
Both of these are at play in this thought experiment.

It is correct to say that, upon first experiencing color imagery, Mary's brain will make new connections.
This is the neurotic part of experience.
There are no new facts entering her mind (she already knows it all) but there are new pathways.


## Theology

Similarly, this experience of hers is not unique to her: all humans have a first experience with color but none have her prior knowledge.
So, is the new experience different for her than it is for the infant?
This is unlikely because the neuronic associations between "green" and "grass" will not have formed until the visual system imprints them.

What's more, though there is a general experience of "green grass" common to humans there is also a personal experience.
When I first encounter a thing which I previously _had only read about_ I am creating new neuronic associations.
What's more [still], there is a conscious connection through such experiences that is new and goes beyond the knowledge of it.

It is supposed that this conscious experience is an intangible level of information beyond anything neuronic.
It is a sort of information that did not exist prior to the experience.
In her explorations Mary has created; she has expanded conscious connections and created new information above that of knowledge.


====

Mary is a scientist who knows everything about color perception in the brain and mind and the physics of color but has lived her entire life in a black-and-white room, viewing the world only in shades of gray.  One day, Mary is allowed to see color for the first timeâ€”  Does Mary learn something new upon seeing color, even though she knew every about it beforehand? 

  If she does, it suggests that some knowledge goes beyond physical facts.  This implies that things have an irreducible "qualia"- irreducible because they cannot be explained in physical terms, quality because they are integral with the thing.  Another, associated, implication is that there are preternatural or supernatural elements to things. 
  This goes beyond the soulish nature of complex organisms.  Even the most basic things in the physical universe have these extra features.
