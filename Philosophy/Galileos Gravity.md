# Galileo's Thought-Proof of Gravity

## Thesis

Suppose you have many cannonballs.
Drop them from a tower and they will hit the ground.
If they are the same size, shape, and mass they will hit the ground at the same time.
Now suppose each cannonball has a loop welded to it's surface.
Tie a thin string from one to the next to the next...
The "system" of cannonballs does not fall any faster because of the connection between them.


## Further

Suppose you have an elephant and a cannonball.
The elephant, obviously, outweighs the cannonball many times over.
If you drop them from a tower they will both hit the ground.
If you tie a thin piece of string around the cannonbal and then around the elephant's ankle they do not hit the ground any sooner.
The cannonball does not hit the ground any sooner because of the thing tethered to it.


## Limits

The reason Galileo's proof works is because our perception of gravity is based on Earth's incredible mass.
Nothing __on__ Earth is nearly as massive as the whole ball.
You could scrape the mantle perfectly flat and the mass of that stuff isn't near the mass of the what's left.
...in fact, the surface of the Earth is, relatively speaking, smoother than a billiard ball.
  From the top of Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench is only 20 miles.
  The Earth's radius is 4000 miles.
  So, the largest deviations on the Earth's surface less than 0.5%.
