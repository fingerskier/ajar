# God

## Is There a God?

...it depends.
Whether God exists depends on the definition of the term.
The Biblical Yehovah is an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, and personal being.
The Bible acknowledges lesser, created beings called god(s).
In fact, the word _Elohim_ is used for God and god as a descriptive of the divinity of these beings;
but Yehovah is set above them as the only uncreated one.
It is that one that we refer to.


## Arguments for God

There are 3 basic argumentative roots for the existence of God:
1. Authority
2. Experience
3. Study

### Authority

Most of our predecessors have believed in God.
There has been, at some point in history, some person more intelligent, more experienced, and more studied than us who believed in God.
Our acceptance of their authority is _a_ proof of God just as much as that of an economics or chemistry expert.

### Experience

Many people have had spiritual, transcendent experiences.
While fraught with problems, many experiences can be analyzed and divested from opinion and bias to be found true.
Further, the providential nature of seemingly orchestrated events [the flow of history] are experiential and are easily interpreted as machinations of the divine.

### Study

We have 2000 years of Christian scholarship.
We have nearly another millenium of Jewish scholarship- with much of the same sacred text as its foundation.
Nearly every question we have about spiritual matters, from the existence of God to the nature of reality to consciousness, has been asked and answered.


## Arguments Against God

Arguments against God necessarily begin with the ideal that God doesn't fit a paradigm that we own.
We don't want there to be a higher authority with an ethic we don't approve of;
We prefer to offer chance, or unknowns, or confounders as explanation rather than an intelligent intercessor.
This is evident when two people with similar circumstances and evidence choose different conclusions.
They do so based on desire based on their presuppositions.

Further arguments are the lack of neatness in localities and the allowance of evil.
Both of these naturally assume that we perceive and understand a large enough context to judge whether they are a lack or allowance.


## Spookiness and Otherness

Werner Heisenberg, the father of quantum mechanics, said, "The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you."
The two main tools of religious zealot are narrowness and piety.
The two main tools of the agnostic are obfuscation and chance.
These strategies are akin to continually emptying the glass and never drinking the last sip.

Couple that with the irreducible complexity of many physical systems alongside their seemingly infinite depth and we have a recipe for continual wonder.
Beginning at a place of humility tends toward a conclusion of some **unknown**.
Then we necessarily anthromorphize and deify that thing.
Yehovah becomes our life's foundation.
Evolution becomes the new faceless, indifferent god, creator of all things- shaped by human will.
In reality evolution is not enough and, were the theory to become law, there would not have been enough time, matter, or information to create the universe as we know it by that process.
And Yehovah does not give enough input for us to believe apart from some modicum of faith.

Where does that leave those of us who disbelieve the traditional God and are orphaned by atheistic zealotry?
Coming from either side we are proposed to have _clung_ to ideology and the raw tenets of some decaying faith.
But, perhaps, it clings to us and we ought to deeply examine this thing on our back as to the color and smell of it.
