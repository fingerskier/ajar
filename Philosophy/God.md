# God

## Is There a God?

Yes... and no.
Whether God exists depends on the definition of the term.
The Biblical Yehovah is an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, and personal being.
The Bible also acknowledges lesser, created being called gods.
In fact, the word _Elohim_ is used for God and god as a descriptive of the divinity of these beings.


## Arguments for God

There are 3 basic arguments for the existence of God.
They come from:
1. Authority
2. Experience
3. Study

### Authority

Most of our predecessors have believed in God.
There has been, at some point in history, some person more intelligent, more experienced, and more studied than us who believed in God.
Our acceptance of their authority is a proof of God just as much our acceptance of the authority of an expert in economics or chemistry.

### Experience

Many people have had spiritual, transcendent experiences.
While fraught with problems, many experiences can be analyzed and divested from opinion and bias.
Further, the providential nature of seemingly orchestrated events [the flow of history] are experiential and are easily interpreted as machinations of the divine.

### Study

We 2000 years of Christian scholarship.
We have nearly another millenium of Jewish scholarship- with much of the same sacred text as its foundation.
Nearly every question we have about spiritual matters, from the existence of God to the nature of reality, has been asked and answered.


## Arguments Against God

Arguments against God necessarily being an ideal that doesn't fit with some paradigm that we own.
We don't want there to be a higher authority with an ethic we don't approve of;
We prefer to offer chance, or unknowns, or confounders as explanation rather than an intelligent intercessor.
This is evident when two people with similar circumstances and evidence choose different conclusions.


## Spookiness and Otherness

Werner Heisenberg, the father of quantum mechanics, said, "The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you."
The two main tools of religious zealot are narrowness and piety.
The two main tools of the agnostic are obfuscation and chance.
These strategies are akin to continually emptying the glass and never drinking the last sip.

Couple that with the irreducible complexity of many physical systems alongside their seemingly infinite depth and we have a recipe for continual wonder.
Beginning at a place of humility tends toward a presumption of some unknown.
This is evident in the anthromorphism, even deification, of Evolution as the new god, creator of all things.
In reality evolution is not enough and, were the theory to become law, there would not have been enough time, matter, or information to create the universe as we know it by that process.

Where does that leave those of us who disbelieve the traditional God and are orphaned by atheistic zealotry?
We are proposed to have _clung_ to idealogy and the raw tenets of some decayed faith.
But, perhaps, it clings to us and we ought to deeply examine this thing on our back as to the color and smell of it.
