# The Frame Problem

How can a system automatically limit its scope to a number of propositions required to produce a result?


## Example 1

Consider a robot designed to make a cup of coffe in a kitchen designed for a human.
There a set of items required for this task: instant coffee, water, kettle, cup, spoon.
If the positions of these items are known the the task is straightforward;
that is, the task of making coffee is directly programmable.
However, if any of the items are out of position, or the shape of any of items varies, then the task is much more complex.
It is conceivable that modern machine-learning models can learn how to navigate and utilize this kitchen but to what level of proficiency?
What if there is, on occasion, trash left on the floor that obstructs the robots movement?
What if the kettle's heating curve is unpredictable?  or the ambient temperature changes significantly?
In practice we can eventually outfit the robot with enough sensors, and constrain the changes within the kitchen, to the point that a robot can perform the task.
However, there is not way of determining the minimum number of sensors and capabilities the robot must have to successfully fulfill its purpose.


## Example 2

A businessman has successfully launched a number of restaurant franchises.
They now want open a health-related franchise that has nothing to do with food or shift-work and involves paid memberships.
The businessman may wrongly assume that their working model is directly applicable to the new venture.
However, they have no way of determining that because they have no way of discerning how much, and in what topological form, they must shift their understanding to successfully instantiate the new venture.
i.e. hiring, payment, and scheduling system are very different and there are sub-systems which are not shared between their current experience and prior.
