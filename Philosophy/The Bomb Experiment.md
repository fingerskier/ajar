# The Bomb Experiment

The bomb experiment involves a single beam, split along one of two paths.  We don't know, in advance, which way the beam traveled.  Also, the paths (including the bomb) are obscured.
Along one of the paths, which we know not in advance, is a bomb.  The bomb may be live or it may be a dud.  If it is armed and the beam travels past it it will explode.
Two detectors tell us which path the beam traveled along.
Your singed face will tell you if that bomb has exploded.


## The Possibilities

      	| Path 1 | Path 2 |
Live, 1	|  boom  |        |
Dud, 1	|  nada  |        |
Live, 1	|        |	nada  |
Dud, 1	|        |	nada  |
Live, 2	|  nada  |        |
Dud, 2	|  nada  |        |
Live, 2	|        |	boom  |
Dud, 2	|        |	nada  |



## The Conundrum

If the bomb is a dud we can't know where the bomb is.

e.g. if the beam travels path 1 and the bomb is on path 1 and the bomb is a dud, nothing happens.
e.g. if the beam travels path 2 and the bomb is on path 1 and the bomb is a dud, nothing happens.
e.g. if the beam travels path 2 and the bomb is on path 1 and the bomb is live, nothing happens.

Either way there is no explosion, therefore we don't either where the bomb is or what it's condition is.


## Usefulness

This thought experiment is a way of evaluating determinism in terms of what did not happen.
An lack of interaction does not necessarily corroborate a measurement.  i.e. we know the path the beam took but the lack of an explosion would mean two different things (the bomb was a dud or it was somewhere else.)
Put another way, the probability of the bomb exploding is 25% [if the bomb is equally like to be a dud or not, and equally likely to be on either path].  However, the probability of a non-explosion telling us whether the bomb is a dud is undefined.
Further measurements may reveal whether the bomb is live but, if the bomb is a dud we will never know its location.

This also has implications on the scientific method and experimentation.
Measurements may tell us the cause of an outcome but we take it on authority that what didn't happen is based on a precursor state or event that we can't know for certain.
We can say for certain that a positive outcome is caused by a particular event and we that another outcome is caused by the state of the sub-system (i.e. the box containing the bomb and the two paths).
However, we cannot say for certain that what didn't happen was a result of any particular precursor.

This has implications in the discussion of free will.
We can say that certain outcomes are predictable based on precursors.
However, precursors of other outcomes (like dud bombs) are undefinable.  We have no way of knowing why what didn't happen didn't happen.
If we make decisions based on measurable manipulations of our life and the manipulations are repeatable, and the outcomes predictable, then we do not have free will.
However, we have no way of knowing that the things we didn't do are caused by anything in particular.
Further, it is impossible to know if there ia gnome in the box moving a live bomb out of the path of the beam.
