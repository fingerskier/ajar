# The Trolley Problem

## Brief

A passenger train is heading for a switch junction- it will go left or right depending on which way you throw the switch.
Across the left track lies your beloved, tied to the tracks.
Across the right track lies thirteen innocent souls, also tied to the tracks.
Which way do you throw the switch?


## Testing & Negligence

This is often presented as a morality test or an exploration into __many vs. few__ arguments.
Perhaps, though, it is more important as an exploration of the consequences and rationalization of life and death decisions.
If we concur that it is more right to save many than few in any case then we always switch the train left.
If our beloved's life outweighs a certain number of other lives then we can simply pile bodies on the right track until the number overwhelms that other love.
However, perhaps we will eventually encounter that one soul who is so romantic, and their beloved so beloved, that no number of innocents can win out.

The decision is the important bit of this thought experiment.
It brings us to confront the modus operandi of our own decision making.


## Neighbors & God

A Bibilical principle is that we should love our neighbors as ourselves and love God above all.
However, the Bible coupled with human experience tells us that one requires the other.
Loving others is love for God is loving others.

In fact, the Christian gospel espouses the idea that God would always switch left- for any number of innocents to the right.
The belovedness is already had and taking their life would be tragic but allows the possibility for the potential of the innocents to be fulfilled.
There is also a multiplicative effect of mercy shown to the innocent adds more weight to the ramifications of saving them.


## The One & The Riders

Additionally, we cannot discount the effect of the decision on the one throwing the switch or the passengers on the train.
Making grand decisions like this is taxing, even breaking, and yields a depth of character that can be gained no other way- it is wisdom, not knowledge.

Such a decision is morally neutral- saving a life is good, taking a life is bad.
A human can justify either decision.
Issues of justice and providence aside- the decision has only one logical answer and exposes the heart of the maker as well as the harsh nature of human interplay.
