# Tautology

A Tautology is a statement that is always true.


## Use

True statements are the basis of proofs.
Every proof has truths underrowing it.
It is necessary to prove "higher" truths as a foundation for those that are yet higher.

Truths can be composed through comparison or commutation.
e.g. A = B, B = C; implies that A = C
e.g. An airplane has wings; wings enable flight


## Expression

Let us take the second example.
If we want to expand our understanding we are tempted to extrapolate from this.
i.e. flyers are airplanes

However, this is ontologically deficient.
Only a minority of fliers are airplanes.
And not all fliers have wings.
This makes it necessary to clarify, or constrain, definitions and equalities.

Tautologies are nearly useless in combination as a basis of proof.
They are highly useful, though, as counterpoints.

i.e an emu has wings but an emu is not a flier.

With this additional content we are to refine our understanding of flight and flyers without delving into extraneous details.
