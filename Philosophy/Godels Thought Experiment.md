# Godels Thought Experiment

Given a set of rules for proving statements, and a statement that says "I am not provable by these rules", is the statement provable by the rules?

If the statement is provable then the premise is false showing that the rules are insufficient to prove the statement.
If the statement is not provable the premise is true showing that the rules are sufficient to prove the statement.


## Outcome

The efficacy of the rules transcend the system in which they operate.
