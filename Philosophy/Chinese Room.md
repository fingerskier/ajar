# Premise

Suppose there is a room with two slots in the door: input and output.
You can insert a paper with one Chinese character in input and the room will generate a paper from output with a Chinese character on it.
The output from the room is sufficient to convince a native, Chinese-speaking human that said output came from someone who understands Chinese.


## Thesis

Those experiment is fraught with halfsies; statements just loaded enough to imply but empty enough to require extrapolation and/or inference.
**I just made up this term `halfsies`**
e.g. convince; what is the intellect and training of this observer?
- if this person is dimwitted they may be easily convinced
- if this person is a highly trained, intelligent diagnostician they be misled (in their zeal) to believe an incorrect nature of the room
e.g. understands; what exactly is it that portrays understanding?
- a child can parrot a response without knowledge or wisdom about a topic
- a skillful conversationalist can probe from a place of partial understanding by asking questions
- -
