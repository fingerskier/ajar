# The Isle of Providence

## Premise

Their is an island called Providence.
Every detail of the island is controlled by the Guardian.
Providence is inhabited by a thriving culture and all weather patterns and relationships are in perfect balance.
Illnesses are rare and resolve themselves quickly without intervention.
The system of justice on Providence is swift and considered, by the inhabitants, to be fair.


## The Problem

You are an explorer who discovers Providence and makes contact with the people there.
You unwittingly introduce a foreign disease that begins to slowly destroy the islander's main food crop.
Now you are faced with the conundrum of whether to intervene yourself, leave, or ask the Guardian for help.
Through collaboration with the locals, and outside help from your country, 


## Omniscience

Did the Guardian know that you would introduce the disease?
If so, then why did the Guardian allow it to happen?


## Divinity's Reach

Can the Guardian be in control of Providence, to the full extent that the islanders believe, without also being in control of the outside world?
What is the Guardian's responsibility to the islanders?


## Evil

Now suppose another explorer comes who knowingly introduces a disease that is deadly to the islanders.
Islanders begin to die.
What does this reveal about the Guardian?  Is the Guardian a moral being?  Is it aloof with interests beyond the well-being of the islanders?
