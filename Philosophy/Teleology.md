...the study of purpose.


## Purposed Things

Phenomena and entities are said to have a purpose if the effect of their actions is not something that would naturally occur.
This is, in a asense, a metaphysical entropy in that natural, chaotic occurrences do not have direction or tend from simplicity to complexity.

For example, evolution and other natural, biological processes are said to deign to improve traits that increase the survivability and reproductive fitness of a kind of creature.
However, one must ask why things must be reproduce or be fit at all.
Apart from a purpose things would seem to drift toward heat-death, disorganization, and rot.


## Externality

A method of thought that would deny purpose, all or in part, would typically add time, mass, or energy at a sufficiently grand scale to subsume thoughts of purpose.
However, obfuscation and complexity defy anonymity.
The greater the complexity and scope of an object, the greater the length of the causal chain from base parts to whole organism.
Each link in the chain that yields more complexity is somewhat improbable.
A chain of a thousand, or million, links is a stack of probabilities yielding an impossibility.
The "Hand of God" must be in such a progression because 1) the improbability demands it and 2) merely identifying the coalescing of stuff into entities assumes it.

Put another way: a system cannot be said to have an instrinsic purpose in all processes tend toward the minima, toward the undone.
The mere perception of order and beauty, or the presumption of some base driving force, assumes a purpose that cannot be innate.
Purpose must be and must come from elsewhere.
