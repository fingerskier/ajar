# The Floppy Disk

A 3.5" floppy disk weighs about 16 grams.
In its default state it contains no useful information, all the magnetic bits are probably random.
Download several megabytes of text, say many classic writing, and the floppy disk still weighs 16 grams.
Has anything been added to the disk?


## Thesis

Information weighs nothing yet affects its context.
The information on a floppy disk comes from the pattern of pre-existing media upon it.
In fact, there is no [appreciable] physical change in a disk when "storing" information on it:
the change is energetic; shifts in the magnetic polarity of particles.

These information are intangible.
What's more, the patterns of idea and thought contained within the text on the floppy disk are another, higher level of information above the bits.
Information storage volume of a medium is constant.
However, restructuring or refinement of the stored patterns can increase information.
