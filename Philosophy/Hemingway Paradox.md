# The Hemingway Paradox

Wrought by Roger Penrose.
Ernest Hemingway killed himself with a shotgun.
__There is some indication that this was, perhaps, and accident but for our purposes we assume it to be an intentional suicide.__


## Premise

The final decision, the internal neural mechanisms of the brain, depends on quantum super-position states collapsing into a "classical" state.
Because all quantum super-position states exist simultaneously until there is a "measurement", i.e. the decision, then the undecided states retroactively disappear.
Is the decision made prior to decision being made?


## Presumptions

All possible states are available in the quantum super-position.
The unmeasured quantum states are retroactively disappeared.
The alternative to this latter point is that the decision is foreseen by the system in which the super-positions were had prior to the decision.
In any case there is some theorized linkage, through time, between the super-position and the measured position.


## Dogma

The implication is that there is a transcendent system which links the decision and the outcome.
Wheeler portrayed a "participatory universe" where the obersever plays a role in determining history.
After and before are not sufficient concepts to understand the decision-making process.
There is always a sense of some envelope which encapsulates the decision and the outcome.
