# Dark Abundance
...is akin to the notion that:
scarcity thinkers work for their piece of the pie thinking there's only one pie;
Abundance thinkers know that God can make another pie.

There is "energy" of some sort in empty space, in darkness. 
We don't yet have the maths or physics to understand completely how that effects us.

It describes latent capacity: unused potential, unexpressed structure, the unseen scaffolding that makes visible order possible.
The silence between notes, not the melody- perhaps the staves theirselves.
The blank database column that quietly constrains the schema.
