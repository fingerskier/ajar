Intellectual honesty requires a falsifiable foundation.


Suppose that we live in a great box.

If observations, within the box, can't be explained by what's in the box then there must be an external input.
If those inputs indicate that the inputter has some level of awareness then it is conscious.
If the inputs are algorithmic then the inputter has some level of intellect.
If the intelligence is self-organizing then the inputter is creative.
If the creations are novel then the inputter is preternatural.
If one transcender has authority over others then it is divine.
