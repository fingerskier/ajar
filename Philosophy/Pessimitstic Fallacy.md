# The Pessimistic Fallacy

The cognitive bias known as the pessimistic fallacy is the belief that things are worse than they actually are.
This bias is often driven by negative emotions, such as fear, anxiety, or anger, and can lead to distorted perceptions of reality.
It often goes hand-in-hand with the "back in my day" nostalgic view of the past.
When we fall prey to the pessimistic fallacy, we tend to focus on negative aspects which leads us to act in accordance with, often exacerbating, pessimism.
