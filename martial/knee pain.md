## Causes

The ankle and hip are rotating more or less than the knee.


## Fixes

Practice slow, proper movements: relax ankle and hip, shift weight to ball or hell of foot, position the knee, flex to secure.


## Principles

Closed chain, leg, is when the foot/hanf is flat against surface that force is applied against.
Open chain, leg, is when the heel or toe is raised (or hand disengaged) against the surface that force applied against.
Note that most movements end with force applied to two surfaces:
  e.g. punch; foot to floor, hand to face
  i.e. the chain is comprised off all joints from the ankle to the wrist
You should be in open-chain when moving and closed-chain when applying force.
This often necessitates quick changes: open-chain to transfer power through the chain, then closed-chain upon contact.
