# Python

## Files

open() returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: `open(filename, mode)`.

f = open('workfile', 'w')

f.read()
f.readline()
f.seek(0)

f.write('This is a test\n')

try:
  f = open('myfile.fs')
except IOError:
  print 'cannot open', filename

seqs = {}

for line in f:
  line = line.rstrip()
  if line[0] == '>':
    words = line.split()
    name = words[0][1:]
    seqs[name] = ''
  else:
    seqs[name] = seqs[name] + line  

close(f)
