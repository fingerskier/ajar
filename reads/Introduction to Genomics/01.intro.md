Genome ~ the program that can produce biological things.  
* The genome, however, does not induce or drive this creation

Mutation ~ an error in the genome program run

Central Dogma ~ information flows in a single direction: DNA, RNA, proteins
- not precisely true

However, Self-Regulation & methylation can affect DNA running and copying, which means information can be directed back to the DNA


NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) ~ a repository of raw sequencing data


Genomics ~ the branch of molecular biology concerned with the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes.

Genome ~ all of the molecular material inside the organism that defines how it works.

23 chromosome pairs
22 identical pairs
1 sex pair

centromere
telomere ~ the ends of the chromosome


bioinformatics ~ the science of collecting and analyzing complex biological data such as genetic codes.
~ the cross section of biology, computer science, and statistics

sequencing machines make mistakes
collecting data introduces biases
tissue samples are not homogenous

====

eukaryotes ~ cells with a nucleus
prokaryotes ~ cells without a nucleus
  baceteria ~ cells without a nucleus
  archaea ~ cells without a nucleus


The Cell Cycle
  Interphase
    G1 ~ cell growth
    S ~ DNA replication
    G2 ~ cell growth
  Mitosis
    Prophase
    Metaphase
    Anaphase
    Telophase
  Cytokinesis

DNA replication -> mitosis -> two diploid cells

Interphase
  recombination ~ the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes
Meiosis
  Prophase I
  Metaphase I
  Anaphase I
  Telophase I
  Prophase II
  Metaphase II
  Anaphase II
  Telophase II
  Cytokinesis


Purines ~ Adenine, Guanine
Pyrimidines ~ Cytosine, Thymine
AT
GC

DNA is direction
from 5' to 3'

RNA has Uracil instead of Thymine
- is also single stranded

A Codon is a sequence of three nucleotides that together form a unit of genetic code in a DNA or RNA molecule.

Amino Acids ~ the building blocks of proteins

Protein synthesis ~ RNA transcription into proteins

====

Human Genome Project
- started in 1989 and completed in 2003

initially they created "maps" which are piece of DNA placed somewhere on the genome


TIGR ~ The Institute for Genomic Research
- first to sequence a genome

Applied Biosystems ~ a company that makes sequencing machines

Whose genome was sequenced first? Craig Venter

====

molecular biology structures

DNA
- wrapped around histones
- nucleosomes

repeats
- short tandem repeats (STRs)
- long tandem repeats (LTRs)
- interspersed repeats

transcription factors
- proteins that bind to DNA and affect transcription

epigenetic mechanisms
- methylation
- histone modification


====

Genotype / Phenotype

Genotype ~ the genetic makeup of an organism
Phenotype ~ the physical characteristics of an organism

SNP ~ single nucleotide polymorphism
- a single nucleotide change in the genome
- associated with disease/trait


Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) ~ a technique used to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a segment of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence.
- DNA is directionatl (3' to 5')
- DNA hybridizes (sticks to itself)
- start with a primer (single, short strand of DNA)
- heated then annealed (cooled)
- one strand yields two DNA strands

1. Melt @ 94C
2. Cool @ 54C
3. Warm @ 72C
4. Repeat


Next Generation Sequencing
- next next is single-molecule-sequencing

1. attach strands to a slide
2. add fluorescent base chemicals
3. add PCR
4. when the fluorescent ACTG attaches, it emits a light
5. take a picture

PCR gives us a large volume of identical DNA strands so that the emitted light is perceptible
The computer analyzes the strength of the color signal to determine the base (because not all strands take up bases at the same rate)


Sequencing applications
- gleaning exonic information
- sequencing RNA, reverse transcribed to DNA
- ChIP-Seq ~ sequencing DNA /protein binding sites
- sequencing DNA methylation sites
