# 6 Spiritaul Disciplines of Healthy Pastors

1. ## Necessity

2. ## Vine Work

3. ## Reading [the Bible]



## The Goal

The goal is godliness.
It stands to reason that godliness cannot be gotten through random action anymore than knowledge can be gotten through random ink blots.
We indulge in text to glean the author's meaning.
Likewise, we indulge in cultic/religious practices to glean the originator's essence.
The "discipline" part of action is the framework in which we operate because, counter-intuitively, we have more freedom to grow with a structure than without.
Spiritual disciplines are these acts within this framework that yield this essense-
Daily christian practices producing godliness.


## The Disciplines

First, personal and private.
Then, interpersonal and public.
Spiritual disciplines should begin as personal, private endeavors.
Once we have a requisite measure of faith and capability we can engage in interpersonal and public practices.
Peoples' acceptance of our public and interpersonal practices is more a measure of our piety and personality than our substance.
We know there are godly people in the limelight just as there are ungodly.

The particular spiritual disciplines in the book are very much of a certain tradition.
The author does not include confession or rhetoric in his list because they are either unknown to him or anathema.

The thesis of the paper is that the vocational pastor ought to be first devoted to spiritual growth.
Their ministry outcomes will flow from this development.
I have a slight contention with this because vocational ministry in our culture includes many aspiritual roles: executive, manager, custodian, fidcuciary, etc.
These are not spiritual states but mundane and there are not special, christian incarnations of them just because they occur in the Church.
There are many secular teachings in these areas just as there are in how to learn and think philosophically.
All of which benefits the Christian in their spiritual walk.
I think this partly what Jesus alludes to in Matthew 15, we have the capability to take in many sources of nourishment and, with divine help, output good or ill.
Implicit in this is idea of transformation- not based on knowledge and practice but the work of the Spirit.

Part of his encouragement for engaging in the spiritual disciplines is to be an "example to the flock".
This is surely a slippery slope.
Jesus rails against the piety and religiosity of the clergy.


## Called to __the_ Disciplines

The basic notion here is that all ministers are called to engage in spiritual disciplines.
However, the same spiritual discipline can yield a pharisee or a saint.
The difference is intent.
This is God _hardening the heart_: as we engage in these practices we are empowered toward a certain end- self-service or self-sacrifice.
Which end depends on which direction we're facing.
It seems natural that a pastor's holiness is subsidiary to their daily work.

Interestingly, it seems that the zealot and Pharisee are both opposite the tepid, dull believer.


## Reading and Praying Scripture

Bible reading is essential.
My opinion is that all major translations can be edifying.
However, once we have eread scripture multiple times it can become stale.
There is a point where we need input from other believers to learn and grow.
Blessedly, we have centuries of good thinkers who had recorded their learnings from Scripture.
In studying these other works alongside our personal Bible reading we can gain a more robust understanding.
Of course, the danger is to cut short our personal reading in place of studying other people.

I have a small contention with the author: "Only in exceptional cases should there be anyone under our spiritual leadership who has read through the Bible as many times as we have."
Honestly, this is ridiculous.
If you have not encountered other believers who know more than you (at any stage of life) then, I would contend, you have a very narrow circle...or you do not know your people.
Perhaps my experience is exceptional but I have encountered **several** non-believers who had a better grasp of Bible (and other sacred) text than I did- and I believe that I have an above average grasp of the Bible and ancillary knowledge.

Additionally, though is may be semantic hair-splitting, I'm uneasy with the phrase "God's Word is the authority behind all our work,".
I understand that ideal of being __solaic_ in ministry but it is God's work.
Otherwise, we should add the five solae: __per opera__.

I appreciate his method of meditation.
This is probably the most profound spiritual practice because it encapsulates reading, prayer, and writing.
The "day and night" issue of meditation is interesting because it implies that we must have scripture permeating our selves.
This is a conundrum for those of us that have __day jobs__.


## Dealing With Problems

It's easy to say, "don't just pray the same thing over and over" but hard to do.
As humans we are often consumed by our current travails.
So, to offer the solution as "read scripture...then pray whatever jumps out at you" is a bit of sleight of hand.
Our minds are pattern [in part] pattern matching devices- what jumps out at us are the things that pertain to our current state.
Now, because it is inspired scripture then it will be edifying and maturing but it is not a panacea.
It's the same as wanting a red car and then seeing red cars everywhere.

What I would add is that we need to let Scripture redirect us.
Additionally, study of scripture (history, words, context) can be that redirecting force to shape our minds.


## Fasting

In the last decade I have, at times, been enamored with fasting.
My favorite book on the subject is "God's Chosen Fast" by Arthur Wallis.
One thing I know is that the mental and physical benefits of fasting are real.
However, these benefits can also be gotten through others means.
e.g. the heightened mental state is derivative of our _fight-or-flight_ physiology.
e.g. authophagy, the bodies recycling process, is heightened while fasting but also while exercising (and then even more so.)

So, it really come down to the spiritual aspect and personal preference.
Jesus, in Matthew 6, saying "when" is just as much an acknowledgment of the societal norm as it is a command.
If fasting is not a societal norm there may not be a "when".
For us fasting becomes an ascetic practice- a way to deny and purge what distracts us from God.
This necessarily involves separation from __norms__.
