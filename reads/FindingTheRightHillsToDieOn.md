# A Review of Finding the Right Hills to Die On
by Gavin Ortlund


## Summary

He comes close to saying that the problem with Christianity is denominationalism...but doesn't quite there.
The thrust is redirected to sectarianism which, he says, is both not as bad as we've been led to believe and yet quite destructive.
I suppose we can collate those two thoughts by pointing out that the Church is very much alive.

The application premise of the book seems to be that there are other true believers with whom we can commune and disagree with on a profound level.
The call is to divest ourselves from the ideal that our partners must share our every belief...or most of our beliefs.
The question, which the book ANSWERS/DOESNTANSWER is the width of that interface and whether to what degree disagreeable positions are to be tolerated (and how they might be tolerated.)

The book delves into many area of leadership and sociology which have been widely studied in recent history.
However, it seems that author is not aware of them or refuses to cite any work that is not overtly Christian.
This is a mistake.
Scientific findings which are peer-reviewed and repeatable are part of the general revelation.
They should, at a minimum, serve as a starting point for any human community leadership issues.
Where they exceed our training and understanding we will grow.
Where they fall short, because of the distinctives of the Church or gospel imperatives, we are wiser for having considered them.
Unfortunately this type of narrow-path scholarship which moves from one echo-chamber to the next is not uncommon nowadays.


## Why Theological Triage?

1. The Church needs to be united
2. The Church is not united
3. Some doctrines are not essential to the faith

He makes the point that we ought not quarrel over "unimportant" doctrines.
There are two things I draw from this:
- Quarreling and debate are not the same.  I would suggest that debate is profitable and quarreling is destructive; and the outcome is directly tied to to intent of the arguer.  Further, it is a sub-text of the epistal materiel on leadership that quarrelsome people are not fit for leadership (thus, those position where doctrinal issues are selected.)
- What is "unimportant" doctrine?  He surely has more to say on this later but the basis is that there are tertiary issues everyone from wink at.  It is the secondary issues, not essential to the faith but essential to the system, which become the sticking point.  Many long-standing, non-essential, traditions are not held lightly and were not kept in place on a whim.  There is often important reasoning behind them and acknowledging such valid differences is a difficult navigation.

Part of the problem hereing is that men, especially younger men, are drawn to the zeal and passion of arguments around secondary doctrines.
It even goes as far as the particular vernacular and language used to divinate primary doctrines.
There is certainly a time and place for zeal in defense of central Biblical theology.
However, we have to [somehow] discern if that zealous piety is a man's default response or a tool he hides under his cloak until truly needed.
This exposes another likely sub-text in the epistal leadership texts: there has to be a significant amount of time spent with a person before they are given sway over a congregation.

I am leary of the "_devil made me do it_" argument.
There are times when demonic influences are at play.
However, humans are quite capable of destruction and abhorrent evil without any help from a devil.


## The Dangers of Doctrinal Minimalism

### Do Nonessential Doctrines Matter?

He gives this list
1st Order: essential to the gospel
2nd Order: urgent for the Church
3rd Order: important to Christian theology
4th Order: indifferent

I find these definitions perplexing.
In management theory triage is done by deciding the importance and urgency of an issue.
If something is important it is:
* something that must be done
* somethings that must be done by me
If something is urgent:
* it must be done now
Things that are unimportant to me I delegate to someone else.
Things are are important but not urgent I schedule to do later.
Things that are neither are discarded.

So, importance and urgency (in terms of the gospel) are beliefs and actions that impact the salvation of people and when...
e.g. the trinity is important but not urgent- it is a core Christian doctrine but one that many people have wrestled with for years;  yet many were saved without a deep understanding of it- some <gasp> with a wrong view of it.
e.g. propitiation is urgent- the gospel is hollow without the concept of the substitution of Christ on our behalf;  His suffering to nullify our guilt - it must be accepted and understood to attain salvation.

It may seem like splitting hairs but the word essential is a bit of a misnomer.
Not every doctrine is as important as every other.
The existence of God, original sin, and the need for propitiation are front-line doctrines.
The trinity, the nature of the church, and the role of the Holy Spirit are still "essential" but they are foundational to the front-line doctrines.

It seems that, when we consider doctrines as binary (essential/non-essential) we run afoul of the same error as the _proof-texters_.
They build doctrine on arbitrary passages of scripture divorced of context.
All doctrines are essential- the question is how important they are to first-time salvation, ongoing salvation, future salvation, and whether _how_ urgent they are for believers (and at what stage of their development.)


### Poverty of Awareness

I think this may end up being my favorite section, pp.54-55, because it illuminates the deep problem with idiot christians.
Those of us who are not trained in theology or philosophy should not take a firm position on secondary doctrines.
Once we attain some enlightenment we can being to soidify our position but too often we start form a staunch position and work the shore it up rather than growing.

"Better to be wrong than indifferent."
