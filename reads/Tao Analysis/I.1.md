analysis of real numbers

Calculus ~ the collection of computational algorithms used to manipulate functions

counter examples:
- ac = bc does not imply a = b if c = 0

the issue at the heart of these counter-examples is stochiometry:
  e.g. lim(-X) = -lim(X) is only valid if the limits are the same, or identical, objects
  i.e. a limit's type is convergent or divergent across a domain; so, doing maths rules have to be applied appropriately


If a(b+c) = ab + ac, for what objects a, b, and c does this hold?

N ~ natural numbers
Z ~ integers
Q ~ rational numbers
R ~ real numbers
C ~ complex numbers
? ~ computable numbers
? ~ uncomputable numbers

Number properties
~ hyperreality
~ surreality
~ transfinity
~ ordinality
