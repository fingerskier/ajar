the structure of choice
- influences
  - societal
  - individual

coping has a lot to do with whether a person has intentionally built a model of that circumstance
  i.e. having a model imposed is a precursor for trauma...?

Even the most bizarre behavior makes sense in light of the choices _generated by_ their model.

Create model ~= Manipulate symbols

Modeling Mechanisms
- Generalization
  - Elements of the model come to represent larger portions of the model
  e.g. Healthy: heat = pain, stoves are hot, hot stove = pain
  e.g. Unhealth: pain = bad, "", stove = bad
  - how pragmatic or useful is it to reverse-engineer the context in which the generalization occurred
- Deletion
  e.g. Health: ???
  e.g. Unhealthy: Selective hearing: not registering praise from others to the extent that, when forced to acknowledge it, it is down-played...
- Distortion
  i.e. filtering/altering a perceived element to match a known one
  e.g. The Scream: the sky is obviously a sky but is a much lower resolution and palette to evoke meaning
