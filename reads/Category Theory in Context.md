# Category Theory in Context

Categories are a mathematical language for transferring ideas from one area of study to another.

a category 


"Injective, Surjective and Bijective" tells us about how a function behaves.

A = ()=>{}
B = {}

if A(x) can produce many results then it is not a function

if B[x] can be had by many A(...) then A is "general"

if B[x] can only be had by one A(x) then A is "injective"

if B[x] can be had by many A(x) then A is "surjective"

i.e. 
  one-to-many is not "functional"
  many-to-one is functionaly
  injective functions are one-to-one
  surjective function are many-to-one

bijective functions are 1-to-1 AND do not have stragglers

a functor defines a transformation between categories


new proof techniques
- diagram chasing
- arguments by duality


inf ~ infimum ~ the greatest element in P that is also in it's subset S
sup ~ supremum ~ the least element in P that is also in it's subset S
