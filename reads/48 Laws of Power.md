The 48 Laws of Power, written by Robert Greene


Never outshine the master: Make those above you feel superior, and avoid showing off your talents too much.
Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies: Friends can betray, but enemies will be more reliable when converted.
Conceal your intentions: Hide your plans to prevent others from getting ahead of you.
Always say less than necessary: Power comes from being mysterious and unpredictable.
So much depends on reputation – guard it with your life: Your reputation is a foundation of power; protect it at all costs.
Court attention at all costs: Be bold and attract attention to establish your presence.
Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit: Use others' efforts to achieve your own goals.
Make other people come to you – use bait if necessary: Don’t chase others, let them come to you on your terms.
Win through your actions, never through argument: Prove your point through results, not through words.
Infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky: Misery spreads like a disease, avoid those who drag you down.
Learn to keep people dependent on you: Make yourself indispensable to maintain control.
Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim: A single act of honesty can cover up deceit later.
When asking for help, appeal to people's self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude: People will act if they see something in it for themselves.
Pose as a friend, work as a spy: Gather information from those around you by making them feel safe.
Crush your enemy totally: Leave no room for revenge, completely destroy your opposition.
Use absence to increase respect and honor: Leave when your presence is no longer necessary, and make people miss you.
Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability: Being unpredictable makes others anxious and easier to manipulate.
Do not build fortresses to protect yourself – isolation is dangerous: Engage with the world to stay informed and connected.
Know who you’re dealing with – do not offend the wrong person: Be aware of the people around you and their power.
Do not commit to anyone: Stay independent and avoid making long-term commitments.
Play a sucker to catch a sucker – seem dumber than your mark: Lower others' defenses by appearing less intelligent or capable.
Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power: By conceding in the short term, you can gain power in the long term.
Concentrate your forces: Focus your resources and energy where they will have the greatest impact.
Play the perfect courtier: Master the art of flattering and navigating complex power dynamics.
Re-create yourself: Never be afraid to reinvent yourself and control your own narrative.
Keep your hands clean: Let others do the dirty work while maintaining an unblemished reputation.
Play on people’s need to believe to create a cult-like following: Use faith and hope to manipulate and control others.
Enter action with boldness: Hesitation is dangerous; be decisive and act with confidence.
Plan all the way to the end: Think through every possibility to avoid surprises and ensure success.
Make your accomplishments seem effortless: Always conceal the effort it took to achieve success.
Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal: Limit the choices of others to ensure the outcome benefits you.
Play to people’s fantasies: People are drawn to the extraordinary, so offer illusions instead of reality.
Discover each man’s thumbscrew: Find others' weaknesses and use them to your advantage.
Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one: Confidence and self-assurance will command respect.
Master the art of timing: Success often depends on striking at the right moment.
Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge: By not acknowledging what you can’t have, you reduce its power over you.
Create compelling spectacles: Capture attention with grand gestures and events.
Think as you like, but behave like others: To blend in and avoid unnecessary attention, conform outwardly.
Stir up waters to catch fish: Create chaos to force others to act rashly, making them easier to manipulate.
Despise the free lunch: Always pay your way to avoid being controlled by others.
Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes: Forge your own path rather than following someone else's.
Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter: Remove powerful leaders to disorganize and weaken their followers.
Work on the hearts and minds of others: Appeal to emotions and loyalties rather than coercion.
Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect: Mimic your enemies' actions to unsettle them and make them lose control.
Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once: Gradual change is easier to accept than sudden transformation.
Never appear too perfect: Flaws and vulnerabilities make you more relatable and less threatening.
Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop: Knowing when to stop is key to maintaining power.
Assume formlessness: Be flexible and adaptable to survive in a world of constant change.
