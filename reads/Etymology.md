# Etymology


1. Before attempting an etymology, ascertain the earliest form and use of the word; and observe chronology.

Chronology is Etymology:
- with no chronological link there is no definitive link


2. Observe history and geography; borrowings are due to actual contact.

Transmission requires contact:
- contact means regular usage
- vernacular may bifurcate meanings


3. Observe phonetic laws, especially those which regulate the mutual relation of consonants in the various Indo-European languages, at the same time comparing the vowel-sounds.

Pronunciation and spelling are not Etymology:
- they might be indicate a linkage but there must be more to prove a linkage


4. The whole of a word, and not a portion only, ought to be reasonably accounted for; and, in tracing changes of form, any infringement of phonetic laws is to be regarded with suspicion.

Etymological links cannot violate language rules:
- compounds and fabricated words may, indeed have an Etymology of each fragment...if those fragments are whole words


5. Mere resemblances of form and apparent connection in sense between languages which have different phonetic laws or no necessary connection are commonly a delusion, and are not to be regarded.

Resemblance does not imply adjacent meaning.


6. When words in two different languages are more nearly alike than the ordinary phonetic laws would allow, there is a strong probability that one language has borrowed the word from the other. Truly cognate words ought not to be too much alike.




7. It is useless to offer an explanation of an English word which will not also explain all the cognate forms
