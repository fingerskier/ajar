fields
rings
groups

Banach spaces
Hilbert spaces

abstract space ~ a set of elements satisfying certain axioms
completeness

metric space ~ a set with a metric __on__ it
metric ~ some thing that associates with any pair of elements at a distance

p. 17

metric spaces play a role similar to the R line in calculus

A metric space is a set X with a metric on it.
The metric associates with any pair of elements a distance.
The metric is defined axiomaitcally.

p. 18


In a __space__ the nature of its elements is unspecified.

Metric space definition
(M1)  d is real-valued, finite, and non-negative
(M2)  d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y
(M3)  d(x, y) = d(y, x)
(M4)  d(x, y) + d(y, z) >= d(x, z)

p. 19

The elements of the set underlying a space are called points.

p. 20

The "Real" metric space is the set of real numbers with the metric d(x, y) = |x - y|

R^2, the Euclidean plane, is the set of ordered pairs of real numbers with the metric d((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)

We can suppose a different metric space as D1(x,y) = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
