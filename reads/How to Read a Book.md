# How to Read a Book

Adler & Doren

The classic guide to intelligent reading.


Ignorance
---------

There is the ignorance of illiteracy and the ignorance of the bookish unwise.

The greek word for bookish ignoramus' is: _sophomore_.


Reading Levels
--------------

Levels of reading are cumulative.

1. Elementary (rudimentary, basic)
2. Inspectional (purposeful, systematic skimming)
3. Analytical
	"Some books are to be tasted, others to be bitten, still fewer: to be chewed and digested."
4. Syntopical

- Skimming
- Inspection
- Analysis
- Syntopical


## Inspectional
---------------

Read title page.
Read preface.
Read table of contents
Read dust jacket
Read chapter summaries
Read a few blurbs here & there - looking for theses
Read the last few pages.

Superficial reading...

Additional readings will surely be required; thus we make each reading more and more in-depth.

Speed - the goal is two-fold: 1) learn how to read at different speeds and 2) learn when to read at different speeds.

Structural Notes
1. What kind of book is it?
2. What is it about?
3. What is the structural order?

Classification

If a theoretical book emphasizes things that are outside of you normal, daily experience then it is scientific.
i.e. a philosophical work appeals to normal, common experience

A work's classification can be wrought by finding out what the author expects you to learn.

1. ?
2. State the unity of a book
3. Write down the major parts of the book and how they apply to the whole work


## Analytical
-------------

Write between the lines

1. Underline major points
2. Vertical lines in margin for emphasis
3. Asterisk in margin to identify theses
4. Numbers in margin to indicate a sequence of points
5. Numbers of other pages
6. Circling key words/phrases
7. Notes in margin/top/bottom as questions or synopses


Rules for finding what a book is about
---
1. classify the book (kind, subject matter)
2. state, briefly what the whole book is about
3. enumerate it's major parts and outline
4. define the problem(s) the author is trying to solve
---
5. find the keywords and come to terms
6. mark the most important sentences and discover the propositions they contain
7. locate the basic arguments in the book by finding them in the connection of sentences
8. determine which of his problems the author has solved, which he has not (and which he knew he hadn't solved.)
---
9. do not disagree until you understand
10. Disagree practicably
11. Respect the difference between knowledge and opinion by reasoning through your disagreements
12. show wherein the author is uninformed
13. show wherein the author is misinformed
14. show wherein the author is illogical
15. show wherein the account is incomplete

identify propositions (declarative sentences, answers to questions)

Amibguity is the enemy of communication
...meaning transference is the heart of disambiguity

arguments ~ affirmations and denials
- give each argument and identifier


Conceptual Notes

Intellectual etiquette of the reader
- reader must be demanding but teachable

Intrinsic Reading
-----------------
read the author's preface and introduction before reading the book


Extrinsic Reading
-----------------
don't read a commentary until you've read the book
...particularly scholarly works

abstracts/digests can help to jog your memory and/or point to adjacent works


```
Homer
Virgil
Dante
Milton
```

Montaigne: "I have no more made my book than my book has made me."

## Syntopical
-------------

Dialectical


1. Inspect all books in the bibliography [generated from analytical reading]
2. Cut down size of bibliography
3. Get the questions clear
4. Create a neutral terminology
4. Define and arrange questions in play
5. Analyze the discussion
