@ Hypertrophy

Muscle growth.


## Idiot Proof

High volume.
Muscle failure.


## Volume

10-18 sets per week [per muscle]

Caveat: 10-25 sets per week for experienced/trained individuals

5-30 repetitions per set


## Typing

Eccentrics
- Negatives/eccentrics at high-load are beneficial

Flexing
- Doing this between sets is beneficial

Quality
- High intensity === muscle failure (can't move anymore)
- ROM ~ every joint through full range-of-motion

BFR
- Blood Flow Restriction
- dangerous, need special cuffs, risk of blood clots

Plyometrics
- Excellent but bad for untrained
