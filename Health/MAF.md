The Maffetone Method, developed by Dr. Phil Maffetone, uses a simple formula called the Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF) equation to determine an individual's optimal heart rate for aerobic training. The idea is to train at this heart rate to improve aerobic efficiency.

MAF Equation:

Base Aerobic Heart Rate = 180 âˆ’ age


Adjustments are made based on various factors:

Subtract 10 beats if:
* You're recovering from a major illness or surgery.
* You're on regular medication.
* You've been consistently training but have been injured or regressed in performance.

Subtract 5 beats if:
* You're recovering from an injury or surgery but without any complications.
* You've been training consistently for up to two years without improvement.

No adjustment if:
* You've been training consistently for up to two years without any problems.

Add 5 beats if:
* You've been training consistently for more than two years without any injuries, with regular improvements in performance.


This formula is used to ensure that your aerobic workouts are done at a heart rate that optimizes fat burning, endurance, and overall aerobic conditioning, while minimizing the risk of injury and overtraining.
