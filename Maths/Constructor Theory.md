# Constructor Theory

Approaching physical laws as amalgamations of which physical transformations are possible and which are not.


## Traditional View

Classical physics is based on trajectories, dynamical laws, and initial conditions.

However, information, heat, and life cannot be accomodated by these concepts.


## Formatting

Laws are composed of objects, mainly physical transformations.

### Tasks

The specification of a physical transformation on some physical system.
A task has input attributes and output attributes.


### Substrate

The object that is changed.


### Attributes

e.g. position, size, shape, color.
Not all properties necessarily change during a task.
An attribute may be virtual, or derived, from other attributes.


### State

The value of the set of attributes.
We will typically only be interested in a subset of the substrate's attributes.


### Constructor

A constructor is something that performs a task reliably.
A constructor is not altered by the task it performs.
An impossible task is one that cannot perform a task to arbitrarily high accuracy and reliability.



## Information

Counter-factual

Copiable

### Knowledge

An abstract constructor can cause changes in physical things.
