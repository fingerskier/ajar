z = r * e ^ (j * θ)

e^(j * θ) = cos(θ) + j * sin(θ)

e^(j * π) + 1 = 0


Low-Pass Filter Phasor
Y = ( 1 10 e − j π 2 ) ⋅ X


ω = 2πf

In essence: the resulting waveform is simply a translation of the original waveform through complex-space...hence the usage of complex-numbers to glean the magnitude and phase shifts.
