3 Steps to mastery:
- cognitive
- emotional
- physical

Step 1 = Save
- My goal is $56K per year into my SEP 401k

Needs
- certainty
- variety
- significance
- love
+ growth
+ contribution

Step 2 - Avoid the Landmines
1. Mutual funds don't beat the market
2. mutual fund fees will suck the life out of your investment
3. mutual funds are not wysiwyg, advertised returns are based on mythical inputs
4. brokers are not necessarily a fiduciary
  a. RIA registered with SEC
  b. only 1 asset-size fee
  c. no stock/bond kickbacks
  d. RIA is not a broker/dealer
  e. money held by a reputable 3rd party
6. TDFs are not a panacea
7. annuities
  avoid variable
  +++ _fixed index_ annuity
8. in a good investment the investee/recipient absolves most of the risk
  "speculative" means your principal is not safe
  protect the downside
  +++ structured note (?Canadian?)
  market-linked CDs
  fixed index annuities (within a Roth)

You get what you tolerate.

Warren Buffet's two rules of investing:
1. Don't lose money
2. See rule #1

My biggest obstacle is my own looking beliefs and perceptions.

3 greatest human struggles
- money

Change
- state
- story
- strategy
  - model someone with a decade of success
