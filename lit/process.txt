1.	Put the data from the Barnstormer-FB-Lead sheet into the format found in the importData.csv sheet.
a.	You will need to rearrange the data so that it matches the order found in the sample import sheet.
2.	Perform the import, assigning the leads to yourself. (more on this later)
3.	Once the import is complete, we will need to manually distribute the leads since we are by passing the distribution functionality in FranConnect.
4.	Under the Sales Module perform a search on leads assigned to yourself and using the zip codes from the respective sales territories to filter the leads accordingly.
a.	Once filtered, assign the identified leads to the appropriate lead owner based on the sales territory.
b.	Repeat for each Sales Territory
5.	The general distribution leads will need to go through a manual round robin process, where we assign the 1st and every 7th lead to the same lead owner and so forth.

Let me know if you have any questions.
