MIT 
- most important thing ~ do it first

Work from a calendar, not a to-do list

The day ends when I'm tired and ready to go...not when I'm done.

Take notes - let the brain process, rather than store, information.

Shut off the notifications.

Meetings are a last resort.

Say no to everything that doesn't support your immediate goals...saying yes to something means no to other things.

80/20 rule: 20% of tasks produce 80% of results.

Focus on your passions.

Batch your work in themes: focus days, buffer days, and free days.

If you can compete a task within 5 minutes then do it immediately.  Only touch it once.

Make the first hour of the day count.

Production comes from energy and focus - not time-spent.
