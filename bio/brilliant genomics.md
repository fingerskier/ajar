A cell's nucleus (or a virus' capsid) contains DNA with 50ATM of pressure


2 stranded helix
  why?  because they can be separated [at any point] and each strand copied or edited by a molecular machine


2nd law of thermodynamics
? a system tends to "maximize it's number of configurations"
  ~ this is poorly worded, double is more than single but singular things outnumber dual
? "a system will tend to minimize it's energy"
  ~ also poorly worded, the amount of energy in an isolated system is constant, the tendency is toward a "lower" form of energy; ultimately heat
- the energy of the system (DNA) is raised by forming base-pairs, the chemical bond creates potential
  - the most likely structure is the one with the most bonds; i.e. no free strands of DNA
  - a corellary to this is that each of ACTG can only bond with one other nucleotide
  

Proteins have [at least] 20 amino acid building blocks
- named with english letters

Enzyme ~ ?active protein?

Native Fold
- one arrangement of C bridges that occurs most of the time (99%)
- a sort of thermodynamic equilibrium of the sub-system of protein molecules
  ? this assumes that the native fold is the lowest energy state; this can't be the case because the environment plays a role which could reverse entropy in the protein

Bridges
- molecular connections that form between points on the protein's chain of molecules
- C, hydrogen, salt, &pi;-&pi;

Mining protein configurations involves calculating the 3D angles of molecular bonds in a certain configuration.  Why is this valid?  Does this tell us anything about the usefulness of a certain protein configuration?
