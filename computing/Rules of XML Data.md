Rules of XML Data


Tag-names = functional description of what's inside of it

Text = data, plain text within a node is the data of that node

Attributes = metadata, information about the data
	think of these as search for types of nodes when running a query or transformation later

Order = the order of nodes can be arbitrary but it is recognizable; so, the nodes can be retrieved by class or by order
