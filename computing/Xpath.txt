Nodes
	element
	attribute
	text
	namespace
	processing-instruction
	comment
	document-node

Atomic Value = a value with no children or parent

Item = atomic value or node

Parent
	every element and attribute has one parent

Children
	nodes have 0 or more children

Siblings = nodes that have the same parent

Ancestors = a node's parent, grandparent, etc.

Descendants = a node's children, grandchildren, etc.

Selections
	nodename	select a named node
	/			selects from the root node
	//			selects any descendant of the current node
	.			current node
	..			parent node
	@			attributes

!!! use xml.setProperty("SelectionLanguage","XPath"); to fix IE bug

Predicates
	[]				demarcates a predicate
	1				digits indicate an index
	[last()]
	[position()<3]	indicates the first two
	[price > 35]	selects all elements with a price element with a value greater than 35


@lang 		selects all lang attributes
[@lang]		selects nodes with lang attributes

Wildcards
	*		matches any element
	@*		matches any attribute
	node()	matches any node

Multiple Paths

Axis = a node-set relative to the current node

Axes
	ancestor
	ancestor-or-self
	attribute
	child
	descendant
	descendant-or-self
	following
	following-sibling
	namespace
	parent
	preceding
	preceding-sibling
	self

Absolute Location Path
	/step/step/...

Relative Location Path
	step/step/...

Step = axis::test[predicate]

!!! Current Node?!

Operators

	+		addition
	-		subtraction
	*		multiplication
	div		division
	=		equal
	!=		not equal
	<		less than
	<=		less than or equal to
	>		greater than
	>=		greater than or equal to
	or 		or

	xmlDoc.selectNodes(xpath);
	xmlDoc.evaluate(xpath, xmlDoc, null, XPathResult.ANY_TYPE, null)
