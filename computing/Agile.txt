Agile


Code is necessary but not sufficient.  


1. Never lie to your customer.
2. Always take the blame if you screw up.


Signs of good collaboration. A project team is collaborating well if:
• Everyone clearly understands the goals of the system (functional and non-functional, schedule and cost).
• The requirements are unambiguous, complete and understood by everyone.
• Everyone is working on the right versions of documents.
• Everyone understands who is in charge and what their individual responsibilities are.
• People trust each other, exchanging information freely.

There is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse.

Cost = number of proxies * proxy productivity ± precision


Cost in Hours
	state machine
	transaction
		low complexity
		medium complexity
		high complexity
	function point

Productivity

Effort = (size / producitivity) +- precision

Your peers production quality is your responsibility, and yours is theirs.
