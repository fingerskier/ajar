# Measure Theory


sigma algebra
    A is a sigma algebra if:
    - it's closed under complements
    - it's closed under countable unions
    - it's closed under countable intersections

    DeMorgan's Laws
        the intersection of the complements equals the complement of the unions

Kolmogorov's Axioms

Lebesgue measure


## Properties of Measures
