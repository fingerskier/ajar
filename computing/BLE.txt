BLE
Bluetooth Low Energy

Peripheral ~ device presenting the data

Central Device ~ consumer of the data ?and/or controller/provider?

Service ~ data channel

Characteristic ~ data presentation/value


Notification ~ signals that data changed
  ...when enabled this automatically sends data to the receiver

Indication ~ like a notification but the reader sends an acknowledgement


BLE is a pub/sub model

Central devices are clients
Peripheral devices are servers

Peripheral

  - custom ~ 128-bit UUID

Characteristic value can be up to 512 bytes


A central device can do these things with a characteristic:
- Read
- Write

- Notify ~ request continuous update


General Advertising Profile (GAP)
- contents
  - device name
  - info
  - list of services
  ! limited size (?)

Peripheral can provide services that are not advertised


General ATTribute profile (GATT)
- defines services
- defines characteristics
- enables read/write/notify/indicate operations on characteristics
