The Truth About The Truth
=========================

The concept in information science is fairly straightforward:
A system attains a piece of information at a specific _system_ time and a _domain_ time.
Ostensibly, the system time is the what's on the system's clock when it receives the information;  the domain time is some arbitrary authoritative time.

Suppose we are tracking an item's ownership:
* We may intially record that Fletchley purchased the Pink Panther May 17, 1974, recorded on May 23, 1974
* Then, Alice purchased the Pink Panther on January 1, 2020- but we receive that record on January 3, 2020
* Later, on March 9, 2023, we record that Bob purchased the Pink Panther on February 15, 2023

With such a set of facts we can both construct a timeline of ownership for the Pink Panther, and also determine it's ownership at any moment.


## Caveatee

This reconstruction is based on the efficacy of the timestamps involved.
So, just as it stands [in our original data] we can potentially glean meta-information from just those bits alone-
* why did the third transaction take so much longer?
* why was it second period of ownership much shorter than the first?

Given insight into the logistics of the monetary and physical transactions we may be able to determine what sort of brokers/intermediaries were involved;  i.e. their proficiency, are they in-person, paper-based, etc.
Given further knowledge about the sale process or ownership requirements we may be able to validate whether sales are authentic.

But knowing the quality of transactions does not give us insight into the personae or the nature of the item.
To attain that we need further authoritative insight.


## Truth

This paradigm of metadata gotten by authoritative insight reveals a fundamental truth about information:
> Not everything can be reduced to a journal of transactions.

Each level of insight requires an application of knowledge by learned individual.
This is what is known, to those skilled in the art, as **wisdom**.
Wisdom flows in the opposite direction of the events-
e.g. tracing the transaction history backward requires knowledge of _how_ flows in this domain.  Not time in general, but time as it is applied to transactions of precious gems.


## Science

Everything begins with authority.
The scientific method was given to you by an authority.
The Book of Enoch says that knowledge of make-up and weapons and drugs were given by divine authority.
Your fear of electricity was given by authority- even if the method was pain from sticking your finger in a socket.
