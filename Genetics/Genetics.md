# Genetics

## Basics

Genes - units of inheritance located on a chromosome.

Allele - alternate form of a gene

amino acids - molecular components of a protein
There are 20.
Composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.

chromosomes - thread-like green carrying bodies composed of DNA and protein.

dominant allele - an allele that make the presence of a receive allele in the phenotype

DNA - dioxyribonucleic acid
Large, organic molecule that stores the genetic code for the synthesis of proteins.
Composed of sugars, phosphates, and bases arranged in a double-helix structure.

Evolution - the emergence of a new trait or species within a kind.

Filial - a subsequent generation.

gene flow - the transference of genes from one population to another.

Gene Pool - the collective genotype of a population.

Genetic Drift - evolution of a gene pool.

Genetics - the study of gene structure and action and the patterns of inheritance of traits.

Genome - the full genetic complement of an individual or species.

Genome Imprinting - an inheritance pattern in which a gene will have a different effect depending on the gender of ?the parent? ?or of

heterozygous - ?

phenotype - ?

## Horizontal Gene Transfer

TE = Transposable Element

cells are fixed/"glued" in place; a complementary process transmits DNA from one to another
