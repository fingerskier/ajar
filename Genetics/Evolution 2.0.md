Evolution 2.0

Neo-Darwinism: random mutation + natural selection + time = Evolution
1. Random Mutation = Noise; noise destroys
2. Natural Selection is not viable (sometimes the underdog wins, i.e. providence)
3. Time; there is not enough time

1. Transposition = re-arranging genes
2. Horizontal gene transfer = exchanging genes w/ other cells
3. Epigenetics = switching genes on/off
4. Symbiogenesis = merging and/or cooperation of cells
5. Hydribization = creation of new species via merger


Teleology ~ a goal-driven system


cells learn
cells colonize
cells rewrite their own code


An urgodic system is one that has random, constrained behavior.
