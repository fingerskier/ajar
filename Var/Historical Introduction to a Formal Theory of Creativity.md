Towards a Categorical Theory of Creativity


Algorithmic composition, algebraic models, and information science have attempted to induce "creativity".
Things like 'entropy' and 'redundancy' may described stylistic properties.
This approach elevates music to the level of _communication_ [from mere notation].
mc ~ what is being communicated?

David Cope: creativity is "the intialization of connections between two or more multifaceted things"...
mc ~ this is just another algorithm, which does not introduce creativity
mc ~ maybe creativity is meta-algorithmic

Cope, cont'd: "can originate from other sources...should not be confused with novelty...synthesizes"
mc ~ synthesis is higher than composition and lower than creativity; the former is a database query, the latter is formulating that query
mc ~ novelty is, indeed, creative; especially when it is subductive


Creativity "results" from mental processes
	combinatorial
	exploratory
	transformational


What makes something creative?
	novelty
	surprise
	value

geometric models for music?

Conceptual Blending
	?presumes a definition of "concept"
	bisociation = a blending of two previously unrelated patterns
		mc ?what is a pattern?  what does it mean for patterns to be related?  what does it mean for patterns to be blended?


Generic creativity model:
1) Exhibit the open question
2) Identify semiotic context
3) Find the question's critical sign
4) Identify the concept's walls
5) Open the walls
6) Display extended wall perspectives
7) Evaluate the extended walls
