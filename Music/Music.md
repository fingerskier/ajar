Music


Freq = FreqRef * 2^Pitch

Interval = Pitch1 - Pitch2

Chroma = the distinctive sound of an interval/chord

Human Ear
	17Hz - 17KHz
	pitch is only reliably detected <= 4KHz
	about 90 pitches total

Scale
	a sequence of pitches
	Diatonic (w/ solmization) ~ identified by the tonic and the order of tones and semitones
		1	do	tonic
		2	re	supertonic
		3	mi	mediant
		4	fa	subdominant
		5	so	dominant
		6	la	submediant/superdominant
		7	ti	subtonic
	Asymmetry ~ if the scale were symmetrical it would be impossible for us to orient in the scale

Degree = an ordered set of names and positions for scale pitches

Octaves are universally recognized

Gamut = the entire range of notes reachable by an instrument

Sonority = a quality by which we group intervals
	perfect
	major
	minor
	augmented
	diminished

Mode = the starting degree of a scale

Final = the initial degree of a mode

Timbre = the qualities of a sound which are not pitch, volume, or duration

Partial = one of many waveforms that makes up a sound.  It can be represented in amplitude, frequency, and time.
   Attack = timespan from silence to maximal dissipation of energy
   Decay = a decline following the attack to a sustainable (?) level
   Sustain = stabile vibration where the energy dissipation matches the exciting force
   Release = end of energy injection to silence

Fundamental = the lowest pitched partial

Overtones = the non-fundamental partials

Harmonic = a partial whose frequency is a positive integer multiple of the fundamental

Ballistics = the change in amplitude and frequency of a partial over time

Vibration Mode = the number of vibrations along the length of the string

Harmonic Spectra = all possible partials for an instrument

Static Spectra = shows the average intensity of partials

Dynamic Spectra = the change in spectra over time

Band = a range of frequencies within a spectrum

Bandwidth = the distance between these upper anger lower frequency limits of a sound

Band Center = the mean frequency of a band

Formant = a group of frequencies emphasized by a resonant system

Octave = double the frequency the referenced pitch
