Deviancy
 = my own term to describe musicality that goes beyond traditional diatonic music.

 This is by no means an exhaustive list but should give the flavor of categorization of these things.  It is curious that so many of the composers that fall into this zany arena have commonality in roughness of upbringing.


 Polyvalence = the use of multiple harmonic functions at once

 Polytonality = multiple, simultaneous melodic lines at once

 Polyrhythm = multiple, simultaneous rhythms played at once (e.g. eight notes opposed by triplets)
