            I     * V
Ionian:		1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Dorian:		2 3 4 5 6 7 1
Phrygian:	3 4 5 6 7 1 2
Lydian:		4 5 6 7 1 2 3
Mixolydian:	5 6 7 1 2 3 4
Aeolian:	6 7 1 2 3 4 5
Locrian:	7 1 2 3 4 5 6


Matching Pentatonics (Lydian and Locrian don't match because of the 7/1, 3/4)

1 2 3 5 6 ~ D M A
1 2 4 5 6 ~ I D M
2 3 5 6 7 ~ D P A

IDM is the most majorish candidate, DMA is a fence-sitter, DPA is gloom
