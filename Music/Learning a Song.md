# Learning a Song

With or without written the process of learning a song is similar.
If you have written music ahead of time, this process is easier but still requires throughput.
I write notes no matter what, when learning by ear notes become esential.

1. Meter
    - what is the time signature?
    - what is the tempo?
2. Pitch
    - what is the key signature?
    - what is the mode?
3. Rhythm
    - what is the overall rhythmic flow?
    - what are the recurring rhthymic patterns?
4. Harmony
    - what chords are used?
    - what is are the chord progressions?
5. Form
    - identify the major partitions of the song
    - glean the order of the partitions
6. Execution
    - establish the forms and patterns in the song
    - be able to play the song
