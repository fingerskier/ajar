# Diminished Chords


3 diminished quads: Adim7, Bbdim7, Bdim7


earth  A  C  Eb F#

wind   Bb Db G  E

fire   B  D  F  Ab


inverting any of these does not change the note spacing within the chord, therefore the quality of the chord remains the same.
Unlike major and minor chords which, when inverted, change internal spacing which affects the quality.
