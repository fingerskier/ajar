# Relative Notation

Root note is determined by selecting the key: "key of G"
Time signature is given like: "4:4"
All pitches are derived relative to the root note.

e.g.
key of G
meter 4:4
1 = G
2 = A
6 = E


## Pitches
----------
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1+ -2 2+ -3 4+ -5 6+ -7


## Chords
--------- 

### Triads
---
I	~ 1 3 5
II ~ 2 4 6
III	~ 3 5 7
IV	~ 4 6 1
V	~ 5 7 2
VI	~ 6 1 3
VII	~ 7 2 4


### Chord Modifiers
------------------
* numbers in chord modifiers are relative to the chord root

I	~ 1st inversion, root in the bass
3/I	~ 2nd inversion, root in the treble
5/II	~ 3rd inversion, root in the midst
4/V	~ indicates another note in the bass (in this case the 4th)
543/V	~ indicates a bass walk-down
IV\2	~ indicates another note in the treble (in this case the 2nd)
IV\23	~ indicates a treble walk-up


* nothing wrong with a little free-wheeling here:
654/II\234
...but this does not indicate rhthym or harmony


## Tablature
------------
|    |   1|
|1215|142 |

* each line represents an octave
** octaves delineations are based on the key, 1->8

* pipe symbols demarcate measures
* each space represents one beat
