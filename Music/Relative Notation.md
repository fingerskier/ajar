# Relative Notation

Once the root note, 1, is determined all other pitches are derived from it and notated relative to it.


## General Info
---------------

4:4			time signature
key of ?	root note pitch class

Once a key is selected notes and chords can be determined relatively.


## Pitches
----------
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1+ -2 2+ -3 4+ -5 6+ -7


## Chords
--------- 

### Triads
---
!	~ 1 3 5
@ ~ 2 4 6
#	~ 3 5 7
$	~ 4 6 1
%	~ 5 7 2
^	~ 6 1 3
&	~ 7 2 4


### Chord Modifiers
------------------
* numbers in chord modifiers are relative to the chord root

!	~ 1st inversion, root in the bass
3/@	~ 2nd inversion, root in the treble
5/#	~ 3rd inversion, root in the midst
4/$	~ indicates another note in the bass (in this case the 4th)
543/%	~ indicates a bass walk-down
^\2	~ indicates another note in the treble (in this case the 2nd)
&\23	~ indicates a treble walk-up


* nothing wrong with a little free-wheeling here:
654/II\234
...but this does not indicate rhthym or harmony


## Tablature
------------
|    |   1|
|1215|142 |

* each line represents an octave
** octaves delineations are based on the key, 1->8

* pipe symbols demarcate measures, each space represents one beat
