Chord Notation


M3, P5 are implied in a single letter

M = major triad base
m = minor triad base (lowered 3rd)
o = diminished triad base (lowered 3rd & 5th)
+ = augmented triad base (raised 5th)

Chord names are capitalized.  Add-on notes are lower-cased.

A number immediately preceding the chord name gives the position.

Numbers & letters before a preceding slash '/' are bass notes.

Numbers & letters after a trailing slash '\' are treble notes.

Multiple slash elements denote a walk.


f#/ g/ a/ 3D \g
	...denotes a 'D' chord played in the 3rd position (slash shape) with an open 'g' string and a walk-up along the low e-string
