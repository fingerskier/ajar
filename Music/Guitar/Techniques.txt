		 = finger falls through to lower string
			all fingers
			w/ slurs
			tremolo
		vibrato
		 = roll knuckle front-to-back with the finger in-place
			vary speed
			vary depth
			meat-slap drill (8th/9th position, side of hand slaps the body of the guitar (higher w/ cutwaway))
			chorded (multi-string)
			bending
				half/whole step
				microtonal
		alternation
			PI, PM, PA
			IM, IA, MA
			string crossing (2+)
			left/right synchronization (scales)
		tremolo

				low
			six-string
			modes
			pentatonics
			single-string tirando

		muting
		chording
			arpreggios
			mode progressions
			harmonic/melodic tone
		barring
			exterior = covering one or both E-strings
			interior = not covering an outer string
			rolled = pressure moves across strings as the notes are plucked ascending or descending
			double = two fingers barring at once
				1/2, 1/3, 1/4

			sweeping
				P, I, M, A
			3-octave (all modes)
				1-octave (all modes)				
		transitions
			horizontal
			vertical
		anti-squeak
		compas
		BPM guessing
		auto-pitch
		tone guessing (relative/auto)				
			scale guessing
		articulation
		left-finger full/empty
		palm-muting
		right-finger nail/pad
		left-hand finger				
		fingerings			
			clean			
		corrective pauses = pickup left-hand and put it back without moving fingers
			= perfect intonation and fingering
		timbre
			natural harmonics
			artificial harmonics
			pinch harmonics
			bridge position
			soundhole position
			neck position
			octave tirando
	Unstrung
		posture					
		thigh rasgueado					
		table tapping
		scissors
		finger flopping = alernate straight finger side-by-side flops
		decomposition = learning music before playing it
			make a copy of the music for each of these phases
			metadata marks (fermata, accents, etc.)
			phrasing (note where the melody/harmony _looks_ like it changes)
			write rhythm counts in 1-e-&-a format
			notate fingering (left & right) and position changes
