Fingering "Rules"
	right-hand
		bass = thumb
		alternate
		minimize number fingers
		prioritize fingers P-I-M-A-(C)
	left-hand
		use anchor notes
		maintain string as much as possible
		maintain shape as much as possible

Unrules:
	You will generally want to preserve either voicings or ranges
		i.e. playing in one position with differing chord shapes preserves the note ranges
		i.e. playing the same chord shape(s) on the same strings preserves the similar intervals in the homophony
	Each right-hand finger has a different sound based on size, strength, and length.  These relative variations are fairly universal.
