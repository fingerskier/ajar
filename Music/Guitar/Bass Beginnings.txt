If we are in the key of G, that means G is the root note, which means it is your safe place: musical phrases want to 'resolve' which means, "end somewhere fluffy sounding", which almost always involves the root.

Here is the basic pentatonic pattern:

-	X	-	-	R
-	X	-	-	5
-	-	R	-	X


Remember that the bass is a percussion instrument: follow the drummer and make a musical platform for the band.  The bassists' job is to give a basis for chord changes.

If you're feeling adventurous you can follow to the 4th and 5th chords as well (in the key of G that's C and D respectively):

-	X	-	-	X
-	X	4	-	5
-	-	R	-	X


Luckily you can use the EXACT SAME scale pattern for those as well:

-	X	-	-	X
-	X	-	-	X
-	-	4	-	5
-	-	-	-	-

-	-	-	X	-	-	X
-	-	-	X	-	-	X
-	-	-	-	5	-	X
-	-	-	-	-	-	-


Furtherhow, key changes (a.k.a. another song) are easy as long as you know where your root note is.  Here they is (on the low string):

F	-	G	-	A	-	B	C	-	D


Finding out what key you're in from the chord chart is easy: there are always 3 major chords; the two consecutive alphabetical letters are not the key, the other one is.  Par example: if there's a G, C, & D then you're in the key of D (beware of horrible tabs that try to get fancy, trust your ear).

To figure out the key from notation you should download a Circle of 5ths diagram.

To figure out the key by ear, just muddling through a pentatonic rooted on A or D (these are the most common chords among all popular keys) and go from there until you figure out something that sounds good.

In short, there's no substitute for learning music theory, but learn the patterns as well.
