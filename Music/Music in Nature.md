Music in Nature


Gareth Loy:  _It is evident that musical scales are free creations of the human mind because they do not occur in nature._

I do not concur with this paradigm.  Dodeca decimal/phonic/measure are natural.  They occur in the human hand, the clock, the circle...  If anything it is a simplification of the natural.
