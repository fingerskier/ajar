Music in Nature


Gareth Loy:  _It is evident that musical scales are free creations of the human mind because they do not occur in nature._

I do not concur with this paradigm.
Dodeca decimal/phonic/measure are natural.
They occur in the human hand, the clock, the circle...  If anything it is a simplification of the natural.

I dare say that the impulse to disregard natural music stems from the same psychopathy that disregards intelligent, transcedant good and evil.
There is no purpose for music except for worship.
The great question of life is who, and how-to, we worship.
