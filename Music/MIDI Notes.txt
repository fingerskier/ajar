terms:
	channel - an independent stream of instructions
		a single MIDI connection carries 16 channels
	controller - a device that 'controls' another
	daisychaining - connection of devices in series
	General MIDI - standard voices
		1 - 128
		2 - more, plus sound editing
	instruction - a message with data
	jack - the connector interface, typically: IN, OUT, THRU
		Soft THRU - throughput is done via software (or non-MIDI hardware)
		two-way control requires matching IN/OUT jacks on the two devices
	length - ???
	messages - 
		aftertouch - how 'hard' a note is sounded
			channel - affects all sounding notes
			polyphonic - affects only one note
		control change - happens in two messages:
			1) the parameter to be set
			2) the new value
			MSB = typically coarse correction
			LSB = typically fine 
			RPN = registered parameter numbers
			NRPN = un-registered (manufacturer specific)
			MTC = MIDI Time Counter
			SPP = Song Position Pointer
		note-on
		note-off
		pitch-bend
		velocity - represents force/dynamic
	multitimbral - an instrument that responds to, or produces, multiple instruction channels simultaneously
	patchbay - single IN, multiple THRU
	quantization - timing
	scaling - adjustments to velocity, lengths, & ???
	sequencer - captures and plays back messages
	SMF - Standard MIDI File, *.mid
		Type 0 - single track
		Type 1 - multiple tracks
	transposition - shift note(s) to a new key
	velocity - ???
