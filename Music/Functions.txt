Functions
 = the degree of tension produced by a note in a scale by moving towards that note and eased by moving away from that note

 Each note, each chord, and each mode has a harmonic function.

 In American music theory we have seven functions, Europeans often teach three:

 I		tonic
 ii		supertonic
 iii	mediant
 IV		subdominant
 V		dominant
 vi		submediant
 vii	leading tone

Tonic 		I
Dominant 	V, vii
Predominant	IV, ii
