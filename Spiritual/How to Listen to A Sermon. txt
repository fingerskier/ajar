1. Always be prepared ~ have daily study times with Yahweh; [2 Timothy 4:1-5]()
2. Beware of proof-texting: using single verses to prove a point rather than drawing meaning from an entire passage.
3. Beware of non-proof: using only non-Biblical sources (especially just the preacher's wisdom).
4. Examine the message in hindsight through the scripture [Acts 17:10-12], in private [Matt 6:5-15]()
