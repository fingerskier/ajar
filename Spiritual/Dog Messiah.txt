Last night Good came and whisked me away on a spaceship.
He brought me to a planet of dogs.
He said, "I love the dogs.
They only way they know that I truly love them is if they hear it is if someone tells them.
And they will only truly accept the message from another dog.
I want you to go tell them that I love them...but:
  You will have to become a dog;
  Most of them will not listen;
  Many of them will hate you;
  After years of you sharing my message of love the worst dogs will torture and kill you;
  But!  I will resurrect you as a sign to them of my power and love;
  And...you will have to remain a dog, with your scars, forever."
