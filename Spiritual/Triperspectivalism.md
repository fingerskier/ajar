# Triperspectivalism
...the coherence of the three perspectives in trinitarian theology


God's perspective
The texts' perspective
The reader's perspective


Timothy Miller understands these as:
- The normative perspective
- The situational perspective
- The existential perspective


This is helpful insofar as we ultimately obtain knowledge from authority, and authority must have a means of revealing it to us.

Initally we may scrape and study to attain it- this is act of the _existing_ creature.
Our existence is knowable and we understand a process by which we can come to know it.

We also have the hand-me-down knowledge of the texts which create the _situation_ in which we can judge our knowledge based on intrinsic experts who share an existence with us.

Finally, there is the _norm_ which necessarily transcends existence- it is what creates the simulation in which we reside.
