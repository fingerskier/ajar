## Channels

A sender and a receiver.


## Message

The sent signal differs from the received one.

How do we discern the original signal based on the received one.


## Encoding


## Decoding

This is the process of removing (or making such an attempt) whatever corruption exists in the message.
i.e. regain the original message from the received one
