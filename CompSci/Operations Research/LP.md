# Linear Programming

An LP is an optimization problem which:
1. Attempts to maximize a linear function of decision variables
2. Has decision variables which satisfy a set of constraints
3. Has a sign restriction associated with each variable

Objective function ~ defines the goal, the one thing to be attained

Constraint function ~ defines limits affecting the objective

Sign restriction ~ function that restricts a deviation variable to a positive value only

## Ramifications of Linearity

1. Each decision variable makes a proportional contribution to the objective function
2. The contribution of any decision variable [to the objective function] is independent of other decision variables
3. These principles apply to variables and constraints 


## Results

### Feasible Region

= the set of all solutions that satisfy the constraints of the system 


### Optimal Solution

= the feasible solution with the largest objective function value 


## Constraints

A binding constraint is maximized for an optimal result.
...a non-binding constraint is not [necessarily]
