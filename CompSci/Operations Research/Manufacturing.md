# Manufacturing

## Variables

cost 
materials/parts
overhead/man-hours

* each of these categories could encapsulate multiple variables


## Decisions

a decision is a variable quantity that depends on system variables under constraint


## Constraints 

these are equalities which limit variables 

this must, necessarily include sign restrictions (positive/negative) where applicable


## Linearity

in order to be Simplex solvable each variable must be independent and must be proportional

so, variables cannot be a function of other variables

this induces the property the problems are solvable and estimatable


## Integers

most manufacturing produces single units, not fractional ones
