# Types

A type is a set of possible values.
Obviously, these may be infinite or not.

Types allow composability and ensure compatibility.

The target of one morphism must be the same type as the source.

Strong, static typing ensures correctness, but not usefulness.


Every set contains the floor element: ```_|_``` which allows a partial function (meaning that it may return a non-valid value).
