DNA is a code.
- directional

transcription -> RNA

messenger RNA -> proteins <- amino acids
~ 3 letter codons -> amino acids

RNA to protein is a standard code


DNA
  ACGT
  ~ A maps to T
  ~ C maps to G

RNA
  ACGU
  ~ T maps to A
  ~ A maps to U
  ~ C maps to G
  ~ G maps to C

DNA commentary sequences makeup a coding strand

RNA complementary sequences makeup a template strand
