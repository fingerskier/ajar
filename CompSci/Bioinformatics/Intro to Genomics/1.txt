DNA is directional
Convention = 5' (left) to 3' (right)

a gene is the code for a protein 


T G C A
A C G T

T A G C
A T C G

prokaryotic ~ no nucleus
eukaryotic ~ with nucleus

DNA is 4-dimensional
...but this book approximates to 1D

String likeness:
- 1D, sequence of letters
- 2D, words ~ definition
- 3D, phrasing ~ meaning
- 4D, flow ~ context

DNA Alphabet:
A C G T
T G C A

RNA Alphabet:
A C G U
U G C A

Amino Acid Alphabet:
A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V

Models:
- multinomial (order 0 Markov chain)
- Markov chains
  - actual is an order 4 Markov chain
  ? perhaps DNA is not a Markov chain because the links are neuronic rather than stochastic
  ? reverse neural net?
