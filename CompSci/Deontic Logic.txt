Deontic Logic
	= a field of philosophical logic concerned with obligation, permission, and related concepts.


O = Obligation
P = Permission


Standard
	von Wright's first system; obligatoriness and permissibility are treated as features of _acts_.

	Set aside for a logic of propositions (by von Wright).

	e.g.	The starving poor ought to be fed
			This implies that there are starving and poor.

	O A === X(!A -> s)


Dyadic
	O(A | B) ~ it is obligatory that A, given B

	P(A | B) ~ it is permissible that A, given B
