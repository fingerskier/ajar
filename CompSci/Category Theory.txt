Category Theory
= mathematical structure as a collection of morphisms

Morphism = an object with a pointer

Category ~ has two properties
	1) can compose the pointers associatively
	2) has an identity pointer

Functor = a mapping between categories
	don't necessarily have lexical meaning but serve to express grammatical relationships

Natural Transformation
	changing one functor to another without altering the composition of the morphisms
