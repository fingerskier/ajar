Bayesian Thought


Updating beliefs after considering new evidence.


posterior = (prior * likelihood) / evidence


P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)

e.g.
	P(A|X) ~ probability of no bugs (A) given that tests (X) are passed

	P(X|A) ~ probability of passing tests (X) given no bugs

	P(X) = P(X and A) + P(X and ~A) * (1 - p)

	P(A|X) = 2p / (1 + p)
