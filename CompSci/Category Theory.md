# Category Theory
~ the abstract-algebra of functions

Lambda Calculus is the calculus of functions
...i.e. a connection between the two


category theory
= mathematical structure as a collection of morphisms

Morphism = an object with a pointer
	morphisms are associative 
	there is an identity morphism

Category ~ has two properties
	1) can compose the pointers associatively
	2) has an identity pointer

Functor = a mapping between categories
	don't necessarily have lexical meaning but serve to express grammatical relationships

Natural Transformation
	changing one functor to another without altering the composition of the morphisms



## Environment

a collection of free variables w/ types


## Topology

f : X -> Y
	X & Y are objects
	-> is a morphism
	X is the _domain_
	Y is the _codomain_

	C(X,Y) is the set of morphisms from X to Y
		or X@Y if the underlying category is clear
		Cop(X,Y) is the "opposite" category of 'C'
		...meaning that it has the same objects and morphisms but the latter are reversed
