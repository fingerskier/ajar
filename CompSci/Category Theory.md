# Category Theory
~ the abstract-algebra of functions

Lambda Calculus is the calculus of functions
...i.e. a connection between the two


category theory
= mathematical structure as a collection of morphisms

Morphism = an object with a pointer

Category ~ has two properties
	1) can compose the pointers associatively
	2) has an identity pointer

Functor = a mapping between categories
	don't necessarily have lexical meaning but serve to express grammatical relationships

Natural Transformation
	changing one functor to another without altering the composition of the morphisms



## Environment

a collection of free variables w/ types
