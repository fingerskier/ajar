Inputs:
a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9
b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9
c0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 c9

Normalize so all values are 0 to 27648

~~~
Some hidden variable/state is causing all 0 readings to be as they are
Likewise, each column has such a variable/state
These virtual states are not applicable, just used to identify time-series-meta-influences

row-reduce this matrix -> becomes the inputs to the neural net
