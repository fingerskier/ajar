# Machine Learning

~ Gain or acquire knowledge of or skill in something by study, experience, or teaching.

## Uses
- "automatic" learning ~ pattern-matching
- complex problems with no known algorithm
- fluctuating environments
~ generic algorithms
~ insightful solutions


## Vernacular

Machine Learning = the application of adaptable algorithms

Classification ...of the input data

Clustering ~ group inputs based on classifiers

Target Prediction ...of the next value

Attribute ~ a data type

Feature ~ an attributed value

Dimensionality Reduction ~ simplification of data
	? holography
	area ~ 4 * pi * r * r
	vol ~ 4/3 * pi * r * r * r

Feature Extraction ~ metadata
	e.g. wear & tear from mileage + age

Anomaly Detection ~ finding items that don't fit a class

Agent ~ the learning system (observes & acts)


## Modularity

DBN ~ Deep Belief Network

RBM ~ Restricted Boltzmann Machines


## Supervision

Supervised
- labeled data
- labels equate to the expected result for that data

Unsupervised
- unlabeled data

Semisupervised
- partially labeled data

Reinforcement
- feedback loops


## Learning

Batch
- offline: churns a set of data, after which the resultant agency is deployed

Incremental
- online: continually feed in new data instances

Rate
- higher rates mean better response to new data but less effective memory


## Generalization

Instance-Based
- initially "memorizes" classes
- then, uses a similarity measure to include new examples

Model-Based
- examples -> model
- model -> predictions


## Process

1. Study the data
2. Select a model
3. Train it
4. Apply the model
