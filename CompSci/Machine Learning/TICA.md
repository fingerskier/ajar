Topographic Independent Component Analysis

Just by virtue of the linked nature of networks: components have meta-dependencies via those links.
The topography of a network imbues dependency via adjacency.

e.g.
An image.
Pixels are "naturally" related by coordinate.
Pixels are "naturally" related by color - this can be absolute or a class.
If we filter an image then we essentially increase the dimensionality of the image - we now have more information about it (even though it is derived.)
So, if we are analyzing a filtered image we may lose the connection to the original - but it still has import.
