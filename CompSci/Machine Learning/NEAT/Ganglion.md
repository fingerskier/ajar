...describes a neural approach which networks a set of classifiers.
Each classifier is a perceptron of some kind generating a feature from some subset of data.
Classifiers may range in complexity from a single node to multi-layered, recurrent, etc.

Some classifiers may take input from an operator, others from instruments, others from historical data.

Some classifiers may divide their output as a means of routing signals.

The general idea is: networks may be self-evolving: adjusting the Topology to improve the outcome.

Individual classifiers are trained according to standard techniques to optimize their particular feature classification.
Network routing is optimized to achieve certain goals.
