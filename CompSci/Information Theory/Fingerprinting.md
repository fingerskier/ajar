# Fingerprinting

## States

The stream of data shall be divided into time-slices.
Each slice has a set of properties ~ tag-values.


## Transitions

The difference between states is a transition.


## Sequences

Each sequence contains a set of states and transitions which occur in a specific order.


## Probability

There must be certain amount of leniency in identifying states and transitions.
Contrariwise the sequence must be as rigid as the states/transs are lenient.
