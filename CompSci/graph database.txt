graph database

apparently the most useful type of graph, for data, is a labelled property graph.

each vertex has:
- one or more labels
- one or more key/value properties

each edge has:
- a label
- a start vertex
- an end vertex

---

node roles -> labels
node attributes -> properties
connections -> relationships

Graph Database Model Validity
- does it read well?
- is it queryable?
- is it extensible with new connections and properties?
