AI 3rd Edition is a scientific book
It presents an explorable interface of major technical aspects of Artificial Intelligence as a discipline.

The general flow of the book is looking at problem solving in general, then the cultivation of "knowledge", then the application of one to the other.


Artificial Intelligence
+ herein the authors try to define AI
+ they try draw parallels betwen AI and humanity
	...I don't think this is particularly fruitful - there is a difference between intellect and wisdom
	...the Turing Test is not a particularly valid way of determining intellect - not to mention Turing did not really expound enough to make it so
? will they define intellect?
? will they define rationality?

- What is AI?
- Foundations
	- Philosophy
	- Mathematics
	- Economics
	- Neuroscience
	- Psychology?!
	- Computer engineering (or just Engineering)
	- Control theory & cybernetics
	- Linguistics
- History
	in general, the history of AI is that we wait for the hardware to catch-up with the math
- State of the Art
	AI is currently capable of doing useful things and competing with humans at thinking tasks
---

- Intelligent agents
	an agent perceives and acts
	agent functions, agent programs
- Rationality = _the right thing_; maximizes expected performance
	a rational agent "does the right thing"
	consequences
	...depends on:
	* criterion of success
	* prior knowledge
	* available actions
	* current percept sequence

	~ learning is implied
	...environments
	PEAS ~ Performance Environment Actuators Sensors; figure 2.5
	agents have structure
