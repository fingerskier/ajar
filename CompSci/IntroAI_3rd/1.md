## The State of the Art

- self-driving vehicles
- automatic speech recognition
- space missions are scheduled and planned by intelligent agents
- intelligent agents are better than humans at many games
- intelligent agents capture 80% [or more] of spam emails
- military deployments are planned and scheduled by AI
- machine translations of human language are usuable day-to-day

## Mindset

* Shall we mode humans or work from an ideal standard?
* Intelligence is mainly concerned with _rational action_
* An AI should the the "best" possible action [in a given situtaion]
* {MWC} Really, AI is not about creating 'minds' but a whole new abstraction for creating computational systems

## Driving Factors

- Math ~ calculus and probability are essential for even the barest understanding of these techniques
- Economics ~ formalized decision-making and analyzing decisions
- Philosophy ~ gave a programmatic paradigm for thought and logic
- Neuroscience ~ uncovered nautral solutions to computation
- Engineering ~ modern AI requires modern-scale computing platforms
- Control Theory


## IMOW

1.1:
- Intelligence = the ability to compose a solution to a problem when not everything is known about the problem-space
