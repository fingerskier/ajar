# Type Theory
~ a notation system for proofs involving equivalence &| execution of proofs


## Intuitionistic Logic
~ logic as if people mattered

Proof_Theory <> Algebra/Category_theory <> Programs/Type_Theory


## Grammar Proof

algebra of proofs
~ alquirisme ~ a method of calculation
...an algebra has to do with equivalent expressions

equal proofs have to be interchangeable in all contexts

proofs as programs


## Entailment
...logical consequence


## Variable

substitution


equality of reference (distinct from sense)
    morning-star / evening-star
    ...same reference to Venus, different meaning (Frega)


equality of sense ~ definitional equality ~ symbolic programming

equality of reference does not imply equal sense


## Homotopy
~ higher dimensional
