# 2 Major Problems With [Biblical Language] Education

1. The people who teach and study [languages] are typically those who excelled within the current framework of grammar-based, technical studies- a small fraction of those who make the attempt.
   Thus, they perpetuate the cycle of erudition and exclusion; not intentionally but by the nature of the that they were one of the few who succeeded.
   In the rest of reality nearly every human learns a [language], most learn it in written and spoken form, and many learn multiple [languages]...without grammatical study.
2. Language scholars have gone to great lengths to create a model of human [language] that encapsulates all permutations of script and sound.
   Epistemologically this is a fool's errand- we do not transmit knowledge through [language] or any other encoding (i.e. a model).
   Knowledge (Logos) exists- a transmittor encodes it in some form (ink on a page, pressure waves in the air, etc.) and a receiver decodes it.
