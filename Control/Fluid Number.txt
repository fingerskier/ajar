Fluid Number


value += _viscocity * (_setpoint - value)

overloading '=':
  X = 100
  ... gradually moves X to 100


In some systems this can be employed when smooth changes are best but interactions are non-linear or excessively complicated.

e.g. interdependent control variables
  Fluid numbers are more efficient than PID and linear systems.  All controls can smoothly move towards a goal while goals are adjusted based on rules.
