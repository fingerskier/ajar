Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing
TDABC

What is being costed, timed, based upon?  Activities.

"Time-Driven"
- implies that activities are sequential...in some way
- activities have a definite start and end time
- start and end times may be relative
	- starts and ends are events
	- events that are not controlled within the project must still be tracked if they convolve activities within the project

"Activity-Based"
- the central _unit_ of a project is an activity
- an activity has:
	- a start time
	- an end time
	- a start condition (the earliest activities start at project_start)
	- an end condition
		- this is the goal met by the activity
		~ creating requirements is an activity
		~ designing a sub-system to meet a requirement is an activity

"Costing"
- this is the amount of resources required to complete a project
- ideally the cost of a project is the sum of all activity costs but there is always overhead
- activity costs:
	- man-hours
	- development equipment usage
	- fuel
- overhead costs:
	- true overhead is the cost of the infrastructure within which the project operates and flows
	- activity transitions [can sometimes be nebulous]
	- project oversight


Cost = sum(activity_cost)
