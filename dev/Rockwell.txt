PID
	operated in Timed or STI modes
		Timed ~ updates at a user-selectable rate
		STI ~ placed within an STI interrupt routine (periodic)
					in this case the STI time and PID rate must be the same
	
	variables: setpoint, process_variable, error, PID, bias, output

	output = gain [E + reset_term * lim(E)dT + rate_term * (D(PV)/dF)] + bias

	gain ~ set to one-half the value needed to cause the output to oscillate
when the reset and rate terms are zero

	reset/integral term ~ set to time equal to the natural period of the gain
calibration
 
		a gain of 1 adds the maximum integral term

	rate/derivative term ~ 

	bias/feed-forward ~ added to the output

	mode ~ timed or STi
					in timed mode the PLC scan-time should be 10x > than PID loop rate

	update rate ~ set 5x - 10x of natural period of the load

	deadband ~ extends above and below the setpoint
							only takes effect after the value crosses the setpoint
