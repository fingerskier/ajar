## Concepts
Take advantage of parallelism (commodity hardware)

Make "big data" more accessible

Make app-dev more elegant

Easily utilize:
- complex structures
- unstructured data
- polymorphic data


## Rationale
Scale
    vertical = more/better hardware
        attainable server limits

    horizontal = more servers
        attainable network limits

Speed

Elegance
