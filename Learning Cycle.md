Exodus


====

Fortification
...is the period of time spent simply surviving.
This where we glean and build up a store of material and relationships.
This is not the building of the foundation but making conditions favorable for later building.


Struggle
...is the hard, base work of establishing the foundation and the land containing it.


Growth
...is the building and furnishing of a structure.
Within the structure we are able to do more than survive.
The better the accommodations, the better the results.


Exodus
...is the process of packing as much as we can carry and picking a new destination.

Very few actually have an Exodus.
