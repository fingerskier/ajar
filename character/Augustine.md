# Augustine

...author of "City of God" and "Confessions" and one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity.
He was born in 354 in Thagaste, a small town in North Africa, and died in 430 in Hippo Regius, a city in the Roman province of Africa.
He was a prolific writer and a powerful preacher, and his works have had a lasting impact on Christian theology and philosophy.

"The scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the only writings that can be called sacred and canonical. They are the inspired word of God, and they are the ultimate authority for Christian faith and practice. All other writings, including the works of the church fathers and the great theologians of the past, are valuable and important, but they are not on the same level as the scriptures. They are human works, and they are subject to error and interpretation. The scriptures, on the other hand, are the infallible word of God, and they are the final authority for all matters of faith and practice."


"Whoever, therefore, thinks that he understands the Holy Scriptures, or any part of them, but puts such an interpretation upon them as does not tend to build up this twofold love of God and our neighbor, does not yet understand them as he ought."
â€” Augustine, On Christian Doctrine, Book I, Chapter 36
